From Memory Care specific day programs in Markham to long-term Memory Care in Oakville, there are specific regulatory standards in place to ensure the health and well-being of those living with a form of Memory Loss.
Keep reading to see how Memory & Company complies with the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority(RHRA) with the support of Ontario Retirement Communities Association(ORCA) to ensure the best care for your loved one living with Memory Loss.
Understanding Memory Care
At its core, dementia is a condition that impairs memory, thinking, senses and behaviour, limiting a person’s ability to perform everyday activities. While it usually occurs in older people, dementia can affect anyone, making it a concern for people of all ages.
Memory Care is a specialized form of dementia care that is designed for individuals experiencing Memory Loss associated with dementia. This type of care is centered around providing a safe and supportive environment that promotes the well-being of those with living with dementia. The main goal of a Memory Care environment is to assist people in maintaining their independence and quality of life through personalized care plans that address their specific needs.
In addition, memory care facilities typically offer a range of therapeutic activities and programs that are tailored to the needs of each individual. This may include memory games, art therapy, music therapy, and other cognitive exercises that help promote mental stimulation and social engagement.
The Role of Regulatory Standards
Since not all Memory Care environments are created equal and don’t necessarily provide the same level of care, the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority (RHRA) has set standards for the quality of care received in Memory Care environments.
As a not-for-profit organization, the RHRA oversees the care management of people living in retirement homes. The RHRA ensures all environments comply and adhere to regulations set forth by the provincial government and inspects retirement homes regularly to ensure compliance.
The ORCA, on the other hand, is a separate non-profit organization that advocates for the rights of retired Ontarians. This association supports seniors and retirement community operators in partnership with the provincial government.
The RHRA and the ORCA both work to protect the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of those receiving Memory Care. These organizations also protect and advocate for each person’s human rights.
RHRA Standards for Memory Care
The RHRA has stringent policies on the living conditions within Memory Care environments including the qualifications and training of professionals employed to provide the care. Actions to prevent neglect and abuse are explicitly monitored in addition to the regular expectations of safety and personalized care.
As part of the RHRA’s guidelines, Memory Care environments need to have a plan in place for each Member that includes a development timeline, a structural support baseline, involvement of the individual, approval by a certified professional, compliance validation, and records of other care partners.
ORCA Standards for Memory Care
To advocate successfully for those living with dementia receiving care, the ORCA has specific guidelines and standards for each Memory Care environment and the available services. This includes guidelines on how to prevent or reduce confusion and anxiety while protecting the safety of those living with Memory Loss.
ORCA also aims to raise awareness about the effects dementia can have on a person and their care partners. Person-centred care in conjunction with engaging activities and programs is the safest and most supportive type of care for those receiving Memory Care.
Benefits of Adhering to Standards
For a Memory Care environment to provide the highest level of care, it must adhere to the industry standards set by the RHRA and the ORCA.
One of the top priorities of the RHRA and the ORCA is enhanced safety measures to protect the health and well-being of Members, employees, and visitors. Monitoring systems such as keypad-locked entrances and exits, doorbells, video cameras, and/or motion sensors should be installed in all areas of the building that are used.
Providing basic shelter, meals, and safety is not enough. Memory Care environments that adhere to the RHRA and the ORCA standards often feature physical, social, and mentally stimulating activities, therapies, and programs to support those living with Memory Loss.
Having regulations in place gives peace of mind to both the families and care partners of those living with dementia or another form of Memory Loss.
Memory & Company’s Commitment
When researching for a reputable Memory Care environment for “short-term or long-term Memory Care near me”, Memory & Company offers the gold standard of service.

With VIP treatment, the person living with Memory Loss and their care partners are provided with person-centred care with research-based programs, activities, and therapies to enhance their quality of life. Having a minimum ratio of one Team Member to every five Members provides focused care and support for each individual.
Choosing Quality Dementia Memory Care
Many Memory Care environments offer varying levels of care even under the regulations and policies of both the RHRA and the ORCA. Knowing how to choose the environment that offers the best quality of care for your loved one is important.
The structure of the environment should be designed based on the needs of those living with dementia. A calming atmosphere that is accessible and offers the comforts of home helps to support those living with Memory Loss.
Professional guidance with a team of qualified nurses, personal support workers, recreational therapists, social workers, gerontologists, and nutritionists, should be available. Onsite access to medical, social, recreational, and physical support therapies, programs, and activities should also be provided.
It is also important to ensure that compassion and support are extended to the care partners of the individual living with Memory Loss through social resources and advocacy with onsite professionals.

[...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/how-ease-transition-to-memory-care-for-your-loved-ones/,"Finding support for a loved one with Memory Loss can be an overwhelming process. From finding the right care environment to easing the transition, it often feels like there are more questions than answers. But don’t feel discouraged—navigating Memory Care doesn’t need to be difficult! With proper forethought and planning, you will have peace of mind in knowing that your loved one is receiving the best possible support.
Preparing for the Transition
To assist you in your journey, we’ve put together this comprehensive guide on how to ease the transition into Memory Care in order to provide your loved one with genuine comfort and a sense of security.
Research Memory Care Environments
Not all Memory Care environments are the same. Some offer limited supervision and physical support while others are completely focused on the daily care for people living with Memory Loss. Ask about the levels of care offered, as some residences have care limitations. Various recreation and social programs should be provided daily with activities tailored to the needs and abilities of Members. Look for locations that offer the majority of Memory Care programs in the Memory Care environment, because often larger homes that have Memory Care floors or neighbourhood rarely take their Memory Care residents to other areas of the residence that aren’t secured.
Tour Potential Facilities
While pictures and videos online can give you an idea of the specific amenities and nursing support available at a Memory Loss environment, only a first-hand look will give you the best picture. Arrange for a guided and personal tour of each of the places you are considering. Look for red flags like bored people, everyone is in their rooms isolated or sat around a nursing stations.  Use your senses; are their offensive smells, people that appear uncared for based on appearance, are there employees engaged with the people.
Make a Plan for the Transition
Once a Memory Care environment has been chosen, make arrangements for the person living with Memory Loss to participate in social activities at the place, see the living quarters, and perhaps even enjoy a meal. Make sure you set as much of the room up as possible with familiar and comfortable items such as a favourite blanket, pillow, pictures, favourtie scents. Anything that will make their new accommodations more relaxing. It is often best to NOT discuss the transition too far in advance due to their Memory Loss. This often causes undue stress and anxiety of a situation they often have little control or understanding over.
Pick a Time of Day That Is Best Suited for Moving
For a person living with Memory Loss, it may be impossible to pinpoint the right time for the physical move to a new environment. Some people are more alert and oriented first thing in the morning while others may be at their best in the early afternoon, though it is best to be as early in the day a possible so they can settle into the space before any afternoon sundowning occurs.
Tips for Making the Transition Easier
Before planning a move to a Memory Care environment, there are several steps you and your loved ones should follow to help everyone involved in the transition.
Acknowledge Their Questions and Concerns
Change can be difficult for any person moving to a new place. For a person with Memory Loss this can cause extreme stress and anxiety. Be sure to answer all questions with empathy, compassion, and reassurance. There may be some anger and confusion at first as they become acquainted in their new environment.
Personalize the New Living Space
Those living with Memory Loss enjoy, and need, to have familiarity on both good days and bad days. Whether it is a favourite chair, pictures, books, or knick-knacks, the new space should be filled with a few items that bring happiness to your loved one living with Memory Loss.
Notify Team Members about Your Loved One’s Needs
The Team Members at Memory Care environments are dedicated to the support and care of people living with Memory Loss. They understand the complexity of the condition and how each individual may require specific care and attention. Provide the necessary information to the Team Members to enhance the overall care of your loved one. Ensure their Care Plan is completed to the best of your abilities to ensure that personalized care and accurate support is provided.
Attend Transition Programs
Reputable Memory Care environments will provide transition programs to support the person living with Memory Loss and their care partner(s). There may be programs designed just for the person moving and programs focused on helping the care partner(s) mentally and emotionally accept the transition.
Visits
The transition to a Memory Care environment can take time and everyone adjusts differently. For some families, the adjustment period can be weeks, months, or even years. It is best to work with your Memory Care professionals to determine the visit schedule. Often when a person first transitions visitors can be overwhelming and upsetting, while others readily accept visitors and the transition is smooth. With Memory Loss everyone goes through transition differently and we take each visit as a learned experience. The Memory Care environments leadership team can guide, based on their knowledge and experience on a case-by-case basis.
Stay Connected
It is important to stay connected with the person living with Memory Loss once the transition is complete. Regular communication is vital to ensure your loved one doesn’t feel neglected or deserted. Staying connected with the Team Members at the Memory Care environment can also help improve communication and reduce stress for the care partner(s).
Encourage Them to Engage with People
A new community means new friends and new fun opportunities. Encourage the person living with Memory Loss to engage in social activities at their new place. The Team Members will offer conversation-stimulating games and activities to help the transition.
Memory & Company Respite Hotel Service

4,The Balancing Act: Managing Your Personal Life and Dementia Caregiving Without Burning Out,"Victor Kwong2024-04-12T00:43:53-05:00April 12th, 2024|Categories: Blog|"," When a loved one is diagnosed with dementia, the dynamics of your personal life transform.

Suddenly, you find yourself in a dual role—a dedicated care partner and a person managing their own life. This new reality can be challenging, demanding an intricate balancing act between providing effective care and maintaining your well-being.
Care partner burnout is a common condition that affects millions of Canadians who have selflessly opted to dedicate their time and energy to caring for someone living with a form of Memory Loss.
In this guide, we’ll explore strategies to ensure that while you’re an essential asset to those in need, you don’t burn out in the process.
Understanding Dementia Caregiving
One of the most critical aspects of Dementia Memory Care is understanding the disease itself. Dementia is not a single condition, but a group of illnesses characterized by a decline in cognitive function. Care partners often witness a change in a loved one’s personality and behaviour, which can be unsettling and require significant adjustments.
Caregiving for an individual with dementia can be emotionally and physically taxing. Care partners can suffer emotional anguish and physical strain while performing daily living activities for another person. Whether the care is part-time or full-time, the care partner is at risk for burnout which can affect the quality of care given.
Understanding the Challenges
Dementia caregiving comes with its unique set of challenges, including but not limited to the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The BPSD spectrum encompasses a wide range of psychological symptoms, necessitating a deep understanding and flexible response from care partners.
Constantly assisting with dressing, grooming, hygiene, eating, medication management, and performing household chores can take a toll on a care partner. Behavioural changes can require constant supervision and may need partial or full mobility support.
In addition, care partners of people living with Memory Loss often experience ambiguous loss—the individual they are caring for is present, yet not the person they once were. This type of loss is ongoing and can be more challenging to manage.
Strategies for Maintaining Balance
Providing quality care for a person living with Memory Loss and balancing your own professional and personal life means establishing specific boundaries. Sometimes that’s easier said than done. Set realistic expectations for what you can do in a day without compromising your mental and physical health.
Ensure that you prioritize self-care, including proper diet, exercise, and adequate sleep. Tending to these needs may seem trivial compared to the caregiving responsibility, but they are essential to your ability to provide care over the long term.
Remember that you don’t have to go through this alone. Building a support network of family, friends, and local support groups can provide the added resources and emotional support you need. Never hesitate to accept help when it’s offered.
Recognizing and Preventing Burnout 
Care partner burnout varies from person to person, but for the most part, it is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion. It’s where you become depleted, both emotionally and physically, and it can seriously impair your ability to care for your loved one.
Emotional, mental, and physical symptoms involve but are not limited to, exhaustion, withdrawal, fatigue, headaches, irritability, and sleep disturbances.
Preventative measures are crucial. Regularly assess your own well-being and separate your personal life from caring by spending time with family, taking frequent breaks, following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and indulging in hobbies.
You can also utilize available respite care services, which provide a temporary break for care partners. This can range from a few hours during the day to a stay in a specialized Memory Care environment to meet your loved one’s needs.
Juggling Caregiving & Self-Care? Memory & Company Can Help You Thrive!
At Memory & Company, we believe it is possible to strike a balance between providing quality care and indulging in self-care for care partners of those living with Memory Loss. We have two locations offering dementia care in Oakville and short-term and long-term care in Markham.

For individuals living with Memory Loss, however, this time of year can pose unique challenges that affect their well-being. Known as the “winter blues,” the cold and dark months can bring feelings of isolation, confusion, and frustration for those living with a form of Memory Loss.
By taking a holistic approach to winter wellness, there are ways to help alleviate these effects and promote a sense of comfort and joy during this season. In this blog post, we will explore how incorporating various techniques such as physical activity, nutrition, social engagement, and creative stimulation can make a significant impact on the well-being of individuals living with Memory Loss during the winter months.
The Challenges of Winter for People Living with Memory Loss
Winter can be a challenging time for anyone, but for people living with Memory Loss, it can be particularly difficult. Reduced sunlight exposure can negatively impact mood, and increased social isolation during the colder months can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. Changes in the brain caused by Memory Loss can make it even more challenging to cope with changes in routine, which can be common during the winter season.
Additionally, these challenges can lead to symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that often occurs during the winter months. SAD can cause a range of symptoms including depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep and appetite, and difficulty concentrating. While the exact scientific cause of SAD has yet to be discovered, medical researchers believe factors such as the decrease in natural sunlight can disrupt the circadian rhythm, cause a drop in serotonin levels, and lead to an imbalance of melatonin levels.
Signs and symptoms of SAD include losing interest in social activities, mood swings, increased anxiety, low energy, appetite changes, difficulty concentrating, and disrupted sleep patterns. Care partners need to be aware of these challenges and provide support where needed.
How to Overcome the Winter Blues
Overcoming the winter blues can be challenging, but it isn’t impossible. Below are a few ways individuals living with Memory Loss can improve their physical, emotional, and mental health during the winter.
Physical Wellness
While Memory Loss, including Alzheimer’s, can rob a person of their memory and cognitive abilities, it can also hurt their physical health. Following a nutritious meal plan with fortified cereals, salmon, eggs, and mushrooms can provide the much-needed vitamin D that is lacking during the winter months.
Engaging in light physical activities such as walking, swimming, dancing, and yoga can also stimulate blood flow, which is vital for brain function. Physical movement, even in small capacities, helps to strengthen muscles, regulate blood pressure, and maintain a healthy weight.
Emotional Well-Being
Individuals living with Memory Loss have a higher risk of developing depression, specifically seasonal affective disorder. Since a person’s emotional state affects their physical and mental health, it is important to incorporate activities that support an individual’s emotional welfare too. During the winter months, it’s recommended that individuals maintain a healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, get enough sleep, and stay hydrated to support their emotional well-being.
Emotional support from family and friends through social interaction can also be beneficial. Visits, phone calls, and trips away from home can help improve the mood of someone living with Memory Loss and reduce their feelings of separation.
Mental Stimulation
Everyone requires mental stimulation during the winter as life becomes slower and there are fewer opportunities to be socially active. Cognitive activities can help boost a person’s mood while keeping their brain active. Group activities can also help stimulate social interaction with others.
Participating in crafts, puzzles, and brain games can help the day pass while improving the ability to use reasoning and rationale. Card games, sorting objects, word games, and engaging in conversations with others provide mental stimulation, especially for those living with Memory Loss.
Therapeutic Practices
Therapeutic practices come in various forms including light therapy, music therapy, and pet therapy. These interventions can be done in a home or a Memory Care setting.
Light therapy is beneficial for those living in areas, such as southern Ontario, where the wintertime has limited natural light due to shorter days. Special light boxes can offer artificial light exposure that helps to boost a person’s mental and emotional state.
Music therapy is becoming an important component of Memory Care and treating those suffering from seasonal affective disorder. When a person living with Memory Loss listens to their favourite genre of music, it can help decrease feelings of depression, isolation, and emotional stress.
Most people enjoy the hands-on interactions with animals. Pet therapy has been shown to boost mood, calm anxious thoughts, increase physical activity, and promote social interaction with others.
Family and Care Partners Support
Just as the person living with Memory Loss can face isolation, depression, and emotional strain during the winter months, so can their care partner(s). Care partners are often faced with numerous challenges in the winter such as time management, financial strain, sleep deprivation, lack of self-care, loneliness, and physical stress. Caring for another human being is a full-time effort and many care partners have families, financial responsibilities, and other jobs to be accountable for.
Incorporating respite care into a person’s Memory Care plan can improve the physical, emotional, and mental well-being of the care partner, as well as the person living with Memory Loss. This form of support can be found in solo or group therapy, Premium Day Programs, and short- or long-term care within a Memory Care environment.

This unique form of Memory Care offers a variety of programs and activities over a period of three days or more in a safe and secure environment. Here, a person living with Memory Loss receives medical care, personalized services, and a chance to engage in social interaction with others. These settings help with daily living activities as needed, nutritious meals, compassionate care, and 24/7 supervision.
For the care partner(s) of the person living with Memory Loss, a short-term care environment provides peace of mind that their loved one is being well care for. It also provides a “break” from the responsibilities for caring for another person and a chance to focus on their own physical and mental health.
Short-term respite care is designed to meet the needs and preferences of the person living with Memory Loss and provides the comforts of “home”. This is incredibly important during the winter season when physical, mental, and emotional challenges become prevalent.
Identifying Winter Challenges
Winter brings sub-zero temperatures, icy conditions, heavy snowfall, and periods of isolation from social interaction. These factors alone pose challenges for those living with a form of Memory Loss. Short-term respite care during the winter season can protect the well-being and health of a those living with Memory Loss as well as their Caregivers.

Cold and Icy Conditions: Winter presents hazardous conditions that could be difficult for those with limited mobility or Memory Loss. Safety is a main concern. It is during this season that mobility issues can increase the risk of slips and falls when venturing outside. Additionally, those apt to wander may find themselves in dangerous situations in the winter season without constant supervision. Wandering outside in sub-zero temperatures can be extremely dangerous.
Cold and Flu Season: Winter is the prime time for colds, flus, and other respiratory conditions. Many people with a form of Memory Loss have a weak immune system which makes them susceptible to illnesses that can be fatal. Memory Loss can also affect a person’s ability to regulate their own body temperature, making them more likely to get sick. Oftentimes, the need for medical care during the cold/flu season leads to frequent visits to the ER or a walk-in clinic.
Increased Social Isolation: The mental and emotional state of a person living with Memory Loss can be affected by isolation from family and friends due to illness and inclement weather conditions. The lack of natural sunlight during the winter season can also generate depression, anxiety, and confusion. This can prompt the “Sundown Syndrome” that occurs with many forms of dementia, as well as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

Questions to Ask When Choosing a Short-Term Memory Care Environment
Choosing the right setting for a person living with a Memory Loss requires patience, time, and research. Not all Memory Care environments offer the same level of specialized care, medical services, 24/7 supervision, or other dementia-related services. When contacting various short-term Memory Care environments, make sure to ask administrative staff these key questions.
What type of care do you offer?
When searching for proper and compassionate Memory Care in the Greater Toronto Area, inquire as to the levels of care provided. Follow-up this question by asking about the type of professional care they offer in terms of physicians, nursing staff, personal support workers, and available specialists.
Where are you located?
The location of the Memory Care environment is an important factor for family and friends of the person living with Memory Loss. The ability for frequent visits and access to community services will benefit everyone involved.
What are your rates?
Payment options should be available to accommodate the needs and budget of each person receiving Memory Care. There may be specialized services that are supplementary. Having a detailed structure of the cost with additional charges will prevent any unnecessary financial surprises.
What is your staff-to-member ratio?
Ensure the staff-to-member ratio equates to personalized care 24/7. A higher ratio will enable Members to receive individual care and attention as needed day and night. A standard ratio at Memory & Company starts at one staff member for every five Members.
What are your qualifications?
The Memory Care environments should be licensed, accredited, and regulated by the local and provincial government agencies and organizations. Inquire about staff training and their experience in relation to dementia conditions and care.
What kind of activities and programs do you offer?
The programming for activities and personalized programs should be focused on the individual’s needs and abilities to enhance their quality of life. Ask about physical fitness, cognitive, social, and specialized programs such as music, art, and pet therapy.
How do you handle emergencies?
Inquire as to the emergency protocols in place for any medical emergencies, evacuations, and other related crisis interventions. Are there enough staff members on-hand at any given time to respond promptly, safely, and effectively during an emergency situation?
Can I schedule a tour of the environment?
It is important to schedule a guided tour of the Memory Care environment to learn about the available support for dementia care in the Greater Toronto Area. Seeing first-hand the condition of the setting and the interactions between staff and Members will provide better insight as to the level of care provided.

7,Why Early Detection of Dementia Is Crucial for Effective Memory Care,"Victor Kwong2024-02-28T02:52:21-05:00February 28th, 2024|Categories: Blog|"," As a progressive disease, dementia can cause physical, mental, and emotional anguish for both the person diagnosed with Memory Loss and their loved ones. While it is not curable, receiving the right Memory Care [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/why-early-detection-dementia-crucial-for-memory-care/,"As a progressive disease, dementia can cause physical, mental, and emotional anguish for both the person diagnosed with Memory Loss and their loved ones. While it is not curable, receiving the right Memory Care in the early stages can help alleviate many of the issues and challenges associated with living with Memory Loss.
Dementia begins as a slow cerebral decline that can affect the daily living, mobility, and overall health of a person as it advances over time. An early diagnosis opens the door to medical and non-medical treatments that may help slow down or prevent the progression of the disease.
Understanding Dementia
Dementia is an umbrella term for several types of degenerative illnesses that target the function of the brain. Alzheimer’s disease is the most commonly known form of dementia, with vascular dementia being the second most prevalent type. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and mixed dementia all fall under the umbrella of dementia.
Each type of dementia has its own set of symptoms that can overlap. Common symptoms are short-term and long-term Memory Loss and impediments with thinking, problem-solving, and language. One or more of these dementia symptoms can make it difficult for someone living with Memory Loss to complete daily living activities.
The Challenges of Late Diagnosis
With early diagnosis, sometimes the progression of the disease can be slowed down and/or prevented with specialized therapy and medication. The problem with early diagnosis, however, is that many cognitive disorders and brain issues, such as injuries and other health conditions, can share common symptoms of dementia. This makes it difficult to diagnose dementia early.
Therefore, it’s more common to get a diagnosis during the middle or end stages of dementia. During these stages, people with dementia may have greater difficulty in performing daily tasks, speaking, and understanding the world around them. People with middle to late-stage dementia may exhibit signs of confusion, wandering, behavioural changes, difficulty in eating, interrupted sleep patterns, and a loss of bladder and bowel control.
While a person in the early stages of dementia may be able to perform most daily living activities with little to no assistance, the disease progresses to the point where full support and assistance are mandatory. The loss of physical, emotional, and mental functions leads to the need for around-the-clock care.
Benefits of Early Detection
This is why early diagnosis is crucial for those experiencing any form of dementia. Lifestyle changes and medication therapy may help slow the progression of the disease. Intervention with dementia Memory Care support has been shown to improve the quality of life for most people diagnosed. This in turn also helps ease the burden on families and care partners who dedicate their time to care for a person living with dementia.
An early diagnosis provides an opportunity for care partners to plan and adjust to the physical, emotional, and mental toll the condition presents. Having the option to be educated and seek proper support through community and online resources can enhance the care given and received. In addition, it is important to include the person living with Memory Loss in all short-term and long-term care decisions if possible.
Early Detection Strategies
With the wide range of symptoms dementia can present, it is crucial to understand the early warning signs. Memory Loss, mood and personality changes, social isolation, confusion, and problem-solving difficulties are key symptoms to be aware of in the beginning stages of the disease.
While many people may brush off forgetfulness or confusion as a sign of aging, you should seek medical advice to rule out the early signs of dementia. Regular cognitive assessments and screening by a trusted healthcare professional can differentiate between the signs of aging and a more serious condition.
Once diagnostic tests confirm a dementia diagnosis, a Memory Care plan that includes various treatments by certified healthcare professionals to manage the symptoms of dementia can be created. This may involve but not be limited to doctors, nurses, clinical psychologists, social workers, general psychiatrists, and therapists (speech, physical, and occupational).
Structured programs that are customized to the individual’s unique needs can be found in Memory Care environments. Reputable settings offer respite care and short-term and long-term accommodations, as well as programs for both the person living with Memory Loss and their care partners.

9,Care Partner Burnout in Dementia Care: The Silent Struggle,"Victor Kwong2024-02-15T01:13:40-05:00February 13th, 2024|Categories: Blog|"," Caring for a loved one with Dementia is an act of love and selflessness—one that millions undertake with devotion and patience.

Yet, amidst the daily commitments and challenges, caregiver burnout can emerge as a silent struggle, affecting countless individuals across the globe. This post delves into the nuances of caregiver burnout within the context of Dementia Memory Care and offers insights into recognition, coping strategies, and resources for support.
What Is Care Partner Burnout?
Caregiver burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion often accompanied by a shift in attitude—from positive and caring to negative and unconcerned. Recognizing the signs of burnout is the first step to finding relief. Some of the signs of care partner burnout include:

Constant fatigue and sleep disturbances
Loss of appetite or interest in activities
Feelings of irritability, anxiety, or depression
Withdrawal from friends and family
Changes in health, such as frequent sickness

This lack of focus, energy, and apathetic behaviour can not only have serious consequences for the person living with Memory Loss but also for the health and well-being of the care partner. It can lead to decreased immunity, heightened risk of chronic conditions, and mental health issues such as depression.
What Causes Care Partner Burnout?
Burnout can be linked to several factors. Caregiving can be physically and emotionally demanding, especially when it involves caring for someone living with Memory Loss. The constant physical tasks and the emotional strain of watching a loved one suffer can lead to burnout.
In addition, many care partners feel isolated and unsupported in their role. They may not have access to resources or assistance from family members, friends, or healthcare professionals, making the burden solely on them. In this case, the financial strain can be hard, especially if the loved one living with Memory Loss requires specialized care or equipment.
What’s more, care partners often have to balance their caregiving responsibilities with other roles such as being a spouse, parent, or employee. This constant juggling of responsibilities can lead to feelings of guilt and inadequacy.
Caregivers often put their own needs aside to prioritize the needs of their loved ones. However, neglecting self-care can lead to physical and mental health issues, further exacerbating burnout. Care partners must take breaks, seek support, and practice self-care to avoid burnout.
Specific Challenges in Dementia Care
Caring for individuals with Dementia presents unique challenges due to the nature of the disease, including Memory Loss, behavioural changes, and the need for constant supervision.
A care partner is responsible for the basic physical and social needs of the person across the various stages of the disease. Daily living activities may require partial or full support from the care partner, depending on the stage of Memory Loss.
Physical care may include mobility support, hygiene, dressing, grooming, and even assistance with eating. These actions are in addition to the physical demands of medication management, preparing meals, cooking, performing household duties, running errands, and ensuring their loved ones make it to appointments on time.
Adjusting to progressive cognitive decline can be difficult, as can dealing with unpredictable behaviours and communication barriers.
Recognizing Care Partner Burnout
Burnout can appear in various ways depending on the person. Some people can handle a significant amount of stress before noticing any emotional and mental symptoms. For most care partners, however, the initial stages of burnout are often overlooked or ignored due to the responsibilities of caring for another person.
Before burnout sets in, oftentimes a condition known as care partner strain develops. This condition often causes feelings of resentfulness, anger, hopelessness, and a lack of empathy. While the physical demands of being a care partner can be expected, overall exhaustion may be a symptom of burnout.
Acknowledging the symptoms of caregiver burnout and getting the support needed is crucial. Some efficient coping mechanisms and self-care practices include establishing a routine that includes breaks and leisure activities, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy diet.
Preventing Burnout and Seeking Help
Memory Care environments, online support groups, and community programs are designed to support the care partner(s) physically, emotionally, and mentally. These support systems are beneficial in helping to prevent care partner burnout through personal and outreach programs.
In addition, proactive measures to prevent burnout can make a significant difference in a care partner’s life. These strategies involve setting boundaries to manage the scope of caregiving responsibilities, delegating tasks to family members or professional caregivers, scheduling time to enjoy activities that improve their mental health, and utilizing community resources and programs designed for caregiver support.
Using the Respite Care services from Memory Care providers is essential. Support is also available from the Alzheimer Society of Ontario, The Ontario Care Partner Organization, local Alzheimer’s Society chapters, the Toronto Dementia Network, and the Family Care Partner Alliance.
Dementia Talks! Canada, iGericare, and CareNav provide 24/7 support.
Discover Support: Memory & Company’s Holistic Approach to Addressing Care Partner Burnout
Memory Care is undeniably demanding, and the propensity for care partner burnout is high. Recognizing the early signs and taking steps towards self-care and professional assistance can protect the well-being of care partners while ensuring the continuation of compassionate care.
We must reiterate the importance of seeking help and support to manage the responsibilities that come with caregiving. Caregivers are not alone in their journey, and resources are available to assist them during difficult times.

10,Furry Friends in Memory Care: The Impact of Pet Therapy on People Living with Memory Loss,"Victor Kwong2024-01-18T03:21:19-05:00January 5th, 2024|Categories: Blog|"," Memory Loss can affect people in different ways, which is why there are a variety of traditional and contemporary therapies available to help individuals dealing with declined cognitive function. Over the years, pet therapy [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/pet-therapy-impact-on-memory-loss/,"Memory Loss can affect people in different ways, which is why there are a variety of traditional and contemporary therapies available to help individuals dealing with declined cognitive function.
Over the years, pet therapy has become a common tool in helping people with socialization, mood control, and motivation in physical activity. While dogs are the most commonly used animal in pet therapy, horses, cats, rabbits, birds, and other animals can be part of the treatment course.
Pet therapy is conducted with a trained animal in an objective intervention role determined by a professional therapist. Depending on the type of animal used and the needs, strengths, and abilities of the person living with Memory Loss, individuals can spend time petting, stroking, brushing, playing, and/or walking the animal.
Benefits of Pet Therapy for People Living with Memory Loss
For people living with Memory Loss, pet therapy can have a profound impact on their overall quality of life. Clinically referred to as animal-assisted therapy, this type of hands-on interaction with animals has been shown to lower stress, boost moods, and bring people living with Memory Loss more joy and comfort.
Pet therapy has also been shown to reduce behavioural problems, which can make day-to-day life easier for both individuals living with Memory Loss and their caregivers. Additionally, pet therapy can facilitate increased social interaction and engagement, which can help combat the loneliness and isolation that often comes with Memory Loss. Socialization is a huge issue for people living with Dementia and other forms of Memory Loss, to the point where the person may become withdrawn and anxious when among a crowd of people.
Being social also translates to increased physical activity. Interacting with animals can increase physical activity and instill a sense of purpose and responsibility in individuals who may be struggling with their independence. In addition, pet therapy has been linked to improved cognitive function, potentially helping individuals with Memory Loss retain important information for longer periods of time.

The Science Behind Pet Therapy
Incorporating pet therapy into Memory Loss environments is not a new concept but it is a growing trend among professionals who are responsible for the health and well-being of people living with Memory Loss. It is no secret that pets have a way of bringing joy and comfort to their owners, but their therapeutic benefits go beyond just companionship. The “person-centred” approach with pet therapy is considered a more holistic treatment compared to the traditional pharmaceutical approach. In fact, studies have shown the act of petting an animal trigger the release of mood boosters known as endorphins, dopamine, and oxytocin.
In one particular study published by the National Library of Medicine for the National Center for Biotechnology Information, it was discovered that initial introductions to animals had a positive emotional result on participants with Memory Loss. A report on the effectiveness of dog therapy for patients with Dementia, published by the same journal, also found pet therapy to be an essential complementary treatment for Dementia symptoms.
The goal of Memory Care is to increase, where possible, the quality of life for the person living with Memory Loss. As seen with the study Animal-Assisted Intervention and Dementia: A Systematic Review, participants who received animal-assisted therapy did have a significant improvement in their quality of life compared to those who did not have pet therapy.
Researchers have also found that pet therapy helps to create a more relaxed environment, which can lead to more meaningful engagement between family members and their loved ones.
Pet Therapy at Memory & Company 
As the world’s first Respite Hotel, Memory & Company has adopted various treatment programs including pet therapy. Specializing in short-term and long-term Dementia care, the participation in pet and other therapy programs has become a fundamental focus in our Premium Day Program.
Pet therapy sessions are used in conjunction with visiting agencies and organizations, such as Hands On Exotics, and Saint John Ambulance.

How to Incorporate Pet Therapy Into Your Loved One’s Life
Before you provide your loved one living with Memory Loss with pet therapy, it is best to discuss their personal needs and preferences with their specialist or therapist.
There are four common types of pet therapy, each with its own goals and characteristics.

Ownership therapyinvolves the participant providing independent care of a pet
Animal-assistedtherapy is a formal interaction to help those with non-verbal communication and confidence.
Animal-assisted activities encourage socialization and physical activity with care and comfort.
Visitation therapyinvolves animal handlers visiting on a regular basis to boost the mood of the person living with Memory Loss.

A pet therapy session is a scheduled series of events beginning with an initial visit to “match” an animal with the right person. Professional care partners and medical Team Members collaborate on the goal of each session.

The holiday season is centred around family, friends, food, and the spirit of giving. But unfortunately, care partners often don’t have the time or energy to give any part of themselves to others aside from the person who they are responsible for providing 24-hour care.
If you’re a care partner, you deserve support—not just during the holiday season—but throughout the year. Luckily, there are structured care programs in place for overnight respite care. Keep reading to learn more.
The Strain of Caregiving During the Holidays
The holiday season presents additional challenges for care partners due to the added demands of preparing for the holidays. With visiting family members, friends, and neighbours, it can be tough people living with Memory Loss to adjust to a change of pace or changes to their daily routine. For some individuals, even the slightest change can cause undue stress, confusion, and anxiety, which can lead to frustration for everyone involved.
Respite care can lighten the burden of finding the time and energy that care partners lack during this time of year.
The Significance of Respite Care
Respite care is short-term relief from the care of others. Primary care partners provide special care and/or emotional care to those who need assistance such as people living with Memory Loss.
Respite care short-term stays in Memory Care environments offer a safe and secure arrangement for both people involved. The person living with Memory Loss receives compassionate and comprehensive care while the care partner has the opportunity to recharge and engage in self-care.
Addressing Care Partner Burnout
Care partner burnout exists. In fact, it is recognized as a state of physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion experienced when providing care for another person. The care partners of those living with a form of Memory Loss are at risk for a number of physical and psychological issues. Burnout can cause fatigue, irritability, frequent illness, gaining or losing weight, headaches, and feelings of hopelessness and social isolation.
The holiday season is a busy time for most people with shopping, wrapping, and extra cooking preparations being done on top of regular daily activities and responsibilities. Respite care can help reduce the risk of the above-mentioned symptoms by providing a “break” or “time-out” from the regular demands of caring for someone.
Care partners need to engage in support from others whether it is through professional respite care, family members, or friends. Other options include simplifying the holiday activities, streamlining the meal preparation for the big day, and starting new traditions.

12,Respite for Care Partners of Those Living with Memory Loss: Minimizing Stress and Burnout,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T07:07:39-05:00November 28th, 2023|Categories: Blog|"," It's an understatement to say that Care Partners of those living with Memory Loss face a unique challenge.

Coming up against cognitive decline and physical changes can be extremely overwhelming, leading to stress and significant burnout. In this post, we talk about the support available for Care Partners, from respite care to counselling and specialized services. 
The Demands of Caregiving for those Living with Memory Loss
Caring for a loved one living with Memory Loss can be a daunting task. It requires patience, dedication, and selflessness that few have the capacity for. A Care Partner provides physical, emotional, and mental support for those living with Memory Loss by assisting with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), meal preparation, social interaction, shopping, medication management, and financial responsibilities. 
The constant demands of caregiving can easily take a toll on the Care Partner’s physical and mental health. In fact, Care Partners often find themselves sacrificing their own needs and desires, which is why it’s crucial to seek support and respite whenever possible. 
Understanding Respite Care
Respite care provides temporary relief to Care Partners by offering support and professional care for their loved ones who are living with Memory Loss. It’s a short-term solution that can make a world of difference for both Care Partners and their loved ones. 
Respite care allows Care Partners to have a break from their responsibilities, which can lead to improved mental health, reduced stress, and an enhanced ability to provide better care in the long term. 
Moreover, for people living with Memory Loss, respite care offers a safe and nurturing environment where they can enjoy activities and social interaction while having their care needs tended to by professional caregivers. It is a win-win situation for everyone involved.
Types of Respite Care
Respite care can mean different things to different people. It can give Care Partners a reprieve for an hour, a day, or even overnight. Below are some common types of respite care available to Care Partners and those living with Memory Loss. 

Short-Term Stays: Most notably described as overnight respite care for adults, short-term care can range from three days to several nights at a licensed Memory Care environment. 
Long-Term Stays: In the event that a person living with Memory Loss requires around-the-clock care and supervision that a Care Partner can no longer provide, long-term stays in a Memory Care environment are available. 
Premium Day Programs: Provided by a team of healthcare professionals, these programs involve one-day and half-day customized individual and group activities that focus on cognitive care, physical fitness, socialization, and overall care. 
In-Home Respite Care: If the person living with Memory Loss is able to remain in their home, in-home respite care involves a third-party Care Partner or Personal Support Worker (PSW) coming into the home daily to offer support.
Adult Day Programs: Offered in a safe and supervised environment outside of the home, these programs provide social and recreational activities daily for those living with a form of dementia. 

Benefits of Respite Care
The benefits of respite care are numerous, offering some much-needed relief to the primary Care Partner. With reduced caregiver stress and improved mental and emotional well-being, respite care allows the Care Partner to recharge their batteries and focus on self-care. 
Additionally, respite care enables the Care Partner to provide enhanced quality care for the person living with Memory Loss. By taking on the responsibility of caring for someone with Memory Loss, Care Partners often put their own well-being on the back burner. Respite care provides an opportunity for caregivers to prioritize their health and well-being, leading to improved quality of life for both the caregiver and the person living with Memory Loss.
Tools and Resources for Care Partners
Below are some tools and resources available to Care Partners.

13,Building a Memory Care Plan: Tips to Help Your Loved One with Dementia,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T07:07:37-05:00November 22nd, 2023|Categories: Blog|"," If you or your loved one has recently been diagnosed with dementia or any type of Memory Loss, creating a customized Memory Care plan might be the next logical step in your journey. A [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/building-memory-care-for-loved-one-with-dementia/,"If you or your loved one has recently been diagnosed with dementia or any type of Memory Loss, creating a customized Memory Care plan might be the next logical step in your journey. A Memory Care plan is an organized and regulated outline designed to enhance the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of a person living with Memory Loss. From physical and cognitive enhancements to financial and health guidelines, the plan offers benefits to meet the needs of the person living with Memory Loss. 
What Is a Memory Care Plan?
A Memory Care plan can be created based on the specific physical and mental health needs of the person living with Memory Loss and their care partner(s). It details personal information, regular daily activities, cognitive abilities, state of health conditions, and preferences. 
Common topics addressed in a Memory Care plan include communication, mobility, toileting, eating patterns, orientation/cognition, psychosocial/behavioural patterns, recreational activities, and care partner support needs. 
The Benefits of Creating a Memory Care Plan
There are many benefits of creating a Memory Care plan for you or your loved one, including: 

Improved Quality of Life: A Memory Care plan focuses on areas such as support, care, and activities to improve a person’s quality of life through structured engagement. 
Increased Safety: Having a Memory Care plan can ensure all safety measures are in place and decrease the risk of accidents. It can also deter wandering and disorientation by being proactive instead of reactive.
Increased Independence: Having a detailed plan for each day can remind and encourage a person living with Memory Loss to fulfill basic tasks such as chores, grooming, eating, and social activities. 
Reduced Stress: A Memory Care plan can help reduce stress and alleviate concerns by formulating goals and support care. 
Improved Interactions: A Memory Care plan outlines specific activities and engagements the person living with Memory Loss can participate in, which in turn can improve their social interactions. 

Tips for an Effective Memory Care Plan
If you think a Memory Care plan might be the right move for you or your loved one, consider these tips.
Understand Your Loved One’s Needs
A Memory Care plan can only be designed based on the unique and specific needs of the person living with Memory Loss. Understanding the existing capabilities of the person in terms of their physical, mental, and emotional strength can ensure the plan is tailored to their needs. 
Develop Strategies to Support Memory Care
When creating a Memory Care plan, developing strategies to address their unique needs will further enhance the quality of life of the person living with Memory Loss. These can include, but are not limited to, being aware of specific opportunities of care available, having legal documentation of the loved one’s financial assets, and having a plan of action as the disease progresses. 
Assess the Skills/Abilities of Your Loved One
An assessment of the physical, mental, and emotional needs of the person living with Memory Loss will be performed by a team of professionals. This stage is crucial to ensure the appropriate steps are outlined within the Memory Care plan to provide the best support and care for their needs. 
Set Realistic Goals
Each individualized Memory Care plan needs to have realistic goals within its guidelines. There are various stages of dementia and no two people experience the disease in the same fashion or timeline. Each person’s physical, mental, and emotional state must be considered and properly managed in the care plan. 
Establish Daily Routines and Structures
A Memory Care environment is designed to have programs structured for those living with Memory Loss. Creating a Memory Care plan based on the available activities, programs, and established routines of such an environment can help reduce the risk of daily disruptions that can cause anxiety and stress on your loved one. 
Prepare for Emergencies
A crucial aspect of a Memory Care plan is to establish guidelines and rules in the case of an emergency. Whether your loved one has an unfortunate accident or experiences a severe health condition, the plan needs to outline the series of events that should be taken to provide the appropriate care. 
Engage Your Loved One in Meaningful Activities
Meaningful activities can be defined as actions that allow the person living with Memory Loss to retain interest in their favourite hobbies and creative endeavours. The care plan can have a scheduled event for painting, walking, gardening, knitting, or playing musical instruments. 
Stay Involved and Connected
As dementia can rob a person of their sense of belonging and contribution to society and their family, it is important for family members and friends to remain involved and connected with their loved one. The Memory Care plan can include activities, schedules, and events that help maintain the bond. 
Provide Emotional Support and Care
A Memory Care plan addresses the need for emotional support and care for the person living with Memory Loss and for the care partner(s). Everyone involved will need to be considered in terms of physical and emotional support to prevent depression and burnout. 
Monitor the Progress
In a Memory Care environment, the families and care partners of those living with Memory Loss should stay up to date with their loved one’s progress. Dementia involves various stages that can cause a person’s health to progressively decline. Reviewing the plan on a regular basis should is important, especially if your loved one is hospitalized, has a fall, change in medical needs or significant weight loss. 
Move Your Loved One to a Memory Care Environment
Those needing specialized Memory Care can receive customized care plans with a move to a Memory Care environment. Designed for safe living, these environments provide extensive programs, housing, meals, and medical attention to enhance the lives of those living with Memory Loss.

14,Interacting with Loved Ones in Memory Care: Effective Communication Strategies,"Victor Kwong2024-01-05T01:00:33-05:00October 25th, 2023|Categories: Blog|"," Staying connected to loved ones is a huge part of our lives, but when a family member moves into a Memory Care environment, it can be more difficult to do so. It's natural to [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/communication-strategies-with-loved-ones-in-memory-care/,"Staying connected to loved ones is a huge part of our lives, but when a family member moves into a Memory Care environment, it can be more difficult to do so. It’s natural to feel concerned about how your conversations will go and you may even worry that you won’t have the tools or know-how in order to communicate effectively.
Below, we explore some effective communication strategies available that can help bridge the gap between you and your loved one who is living with Memory Loss. 
Common Communication Barriers 
Communicating effectively can be difficult for those living with Memory Loss. Often, it can feel like the right words are just out of reach. Deteriorating cognitive function can cause all sorts of communication barriers, including forgetting words, losing track of thoughts, and becoming easily distracted. These barriers can result in breakdowns in communication, leading to frustration, misunderstandings, and even isolation. 
In addition, it’s not just about finding the words to say either. It’s also about interpreting them accurately. Sometimes people living with Memory Loss have a hard time interpreting words and understanding the speaker’s intent. Background noise or other environmental distractions can also make it harder to communicate and be understood. 
Effective Communication Strategies
Memory Loss can have an adverse effect on the way a person uses their communication skills. While this aspect of the disease cannot be reversed, there are some effective communication strategies that can help those living with Memory Loss engage in meaningful conversations with friends and family. 
Use Simple Language and Short Sentences
When conversing with someone who is living with Memory Loss, try to use shorter sentences and/or ask questions that require either a “yes” or “no” answer. Regardless of their past communication skills, dementia and other forms of Memory Loss can often affect a person’s comprehension and make even the most basic topics of conversation difficult. Using simple language and common, everyday terms can help reduce their anxiety in social settings.  
Speak Slowly and Clearly
Whether the person living with Memory Loss was once a vibrant, loud, fast talker or was reserved and spoke quietly, try to speak slowly and clearly when communicating. Using a calming voice, a gentle tone, and an understandable language, communicate with compassion and empathy. This will provide reassurance and supportive responsiveness for your loved one living with Memory Loss who may be having trouble communicating. 
Make Eye Contact and Use Facial Expressions
As adults we are told to maintain eye contact when speaking to people—whether it be a friend, coworker, or authoritative figure. This shows respect and acknowledges that we are attentive. This rule remains the same when communicating with a person living with a form of dementia or Memory Loss. Eye contact and positive facial expressions are ways to reinforce and maintain communication with the person. 
Be Patient and Understanding
Patience is a virtue and when communicating with a person living with Memory Loss, this is key in providing the support and understanding they may need. Allow the person to speak their thoughts in their own time. It is advisable not to interrupt or “rush” them through a conversation. Offer reassurance through patience while the person gathers their thoughts and attempts to verbally or non-verbally communicate with you. 
Listen Carefully
Listening to someone speak about their experiences, needs, feelings, emotions, and thoughts is a major part of effective communication. Using verbal and non-verbal communication to actively listen can help support the person living with Memory Loss. Listen for cues in their conversation to give positive feedback through eye contact and nodding of the head. 
Validate Their Feelings
By acknowledging their emotions, you show your loved one who is living with Memory Loss that you understand and care about what they are going through. This can help them feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences with you. Remember to listen attentively and speak in a calm and reassuring tone. 
Use Non-Verbal Communication
A wonderful thing about communication practices is there are many non-verbal cues to replace the spoken word. Pointing, gesturing, and other hand movements can speak volumes when there is a breakdown in communication. Use a gentle touch when speaking to the person and, whenever possible, depend on the senses (touch, sight, taste, smell, and sound) as communication. 
Avoid Arguing or Correcting Your Loved One
Dementia can cause a person to quickly become flustered or angry when engaging in conversation. If the person says something that is not true or begins to argue about a topic, do not correct them or try to change their opinion. Try to understand their point of view and repeat it back to them for clarification. Debating with a person who is living with Memory Loss can cause greater stress to their mental state. 
Use Humour Sparingly
It is said that laughter is the best medicine and with Memory Care, it helps in most situations. While humour and laughter help to ease communication strain, it is important to remember to ensure the person living with Memory Loss does not feel offended. Use humourous jokes and actions to lighten the mood, not at their expense. Never laugh or joke about to make fun of the person having trouble to speak.

The care should be personalized to meet the needs of the person while preserving their dignity and independence, wherever possible. 
Understanding Dementia and its Challenges
When a person is diagnosed with dementia, it refers to a series of symptoms that impede cognitive function of the memory, communication, reasoning, concentration, and/or perception. Dementia is a broad term for mild, moderate, and severe conditions that impact certain areas of the brain that have sustained injury, damage, or destruction. 
Dementia can be seen in the form of Memory Loss and regression in the ability to walk, speak, and/or swallow. It can cause irritability, hopelessness, confusion, severe mood swings, and detachment from the world. 
The impact of dementia on care partners can cause anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. The emotional and physical toll of caring for a person with Memory Loss can be heavy and it could affect a care partner’s own health and well-being. 
Introducing Boutique Memory Care
Thankfully, there are specialized environments to help those care partners and the person living with Memory Loss known as Memory Care settings. Unlike the traditional Long Term Care or general retirement homes, these surroundings are physically designed with the safety, ease of use and security of the person living with Memory Loss in mind. 
Professionally trained individuals provide compassionate and supportive care on a 24/7 basis with medical and social therapy as the dementia symptoms progress. Programs and activities are personalized in respect to the unique needs of each individual to enhance their quality of life. 
Creating a Supportive Environment
A supportive environment is the goal of a Memory Care program. The setting requires particular planning and design to offer a comfortable, safe, and familiar environment for the person living with Memory Loss. The aim is to create an easy-to-navigate area with little to no risk for injury and/or confusion. This may involve use of non-slip floors, high contrasting colours, circular halls, and non-reflective flooring and surfaces.
As sensory stimulation plays a major role in Memory Loss, the environment should offer a calm and serene atmosphere with controlled noise and visual stimulus. 
Building Meaningful Connections
Due to the delicate nature of dementia and Memory Loss, Memory Care must meet the unique and individual needs of each person. From physical support to emotional support, a person-centred care approach is warranted.  
A Memory Care setting should have a small staff-to-resident ratio to ensure each Member receives the best care. A person with Memory Loss may require assistance with grooming activities, bathing, eating, safety monitoring and/or constant social encouragement. 
Tailored Activities and Programs
Memory Care settings need to offer individualized activities and programs that meet the needs, likes, and abilities of the person living with Memory Loss. Each program should encourage involvement in social settings while providing a form of therapy to enhance the quality of life of the Member. 
These programs can involve music, art, cognitive games, physical recreation, or group participation activities. By focusing on the relationship between the person living with Memory Loss and the trust built with Team Members, an individual can gain self-confidence, independence, and a sense of comfort in their new surroundings. 
Collaboration with Families and Care Partners
Whether the person living with Memory Loss requires short-term or long-term care in a Memory Care setting, it is important for families and care partners to form a good relationship with Team Members. A collaborative approach can benefit everyone involved.
Regular visits, phone calls, and support from family members can enhance and improve their loved one’s physical, mental, and emotional state. Care partners can receive respite support, education, advocacy, and resources to assist in maintaining a relationship with the person living with Memory Loss. 
Team Members Training and Expertise
Excellence in care and support would not be possible without the expertise and training of those who work as Team Members within Memory Care environments. These professionals have knowledge of Memory Loss and other symptoms of dementia to provide empathic and compassionate care. 
Ongoing training and education in the physical and emotional care for a person living with Memory Loss involves understanding changing behaviour patterns as the symptoms progress. Having onsite access to personal support workers, nurses, social workers, recreational therapists, and nutritionists is crucial to the quality of life of Members.

Music can evoke various emotions and/or memories of a different time. Using music as a therapeutic stimulation can help improve the physical, emotional, and mental state of a person living with Memory Loss. 
What Is Music Therapy?
The Canadian Association of Music Therapists defines music therapy as “a discipline in which Certified Music Therapists (MTAs) use music purposefully within therapeutic relationships to support development, health, and well-being”.
A structured music therapy session in a Memory Care environment is similar to the method used by millions of people every day in the comfort of their home to unwind or relieve stress. As a therapeutic tool, music can be played in conjunction with other forms of therapy, depending on the intended audience. 
How Does Music Therapy Help With Memory Loss?
Music therapy is referred to as a non-pharmaceutical method of treatment for those living with Memory Loss. It can be used to reduce agitation or aggression demonstrated by a person with living with dementia. It can also be used to evoke happy emotions in someone who may feel depressed, isolated, or lonely. 
How Does Music Affect the Brain?
To understand how music therapy for people living with Memory Loss is used, it is important to recognize how music affects the brain. 
The limbic system of the brain processes emotional and behavioural responses. Hearing music increases blood flow to this and other regions of the brain that control emotions. Our brain releases neurotransmitters, which are chemical messages, as a response to the sound of music. The dopamine neurotransmitter that is released is known for giving us our “feel good” emotions. 
When music is played for people living with Memory Loss, feelings of calm and relaxation can be experienced, especially if the music stimulates a happy “memory”.  People living with Memory Loss may similarly experience feelings of distress with music that generates negative emotions.
Case Studies 
A recent study titled The Effects of Music Therapy on Patients with Dementia looked into the influence music therapy has on individuals living with Memory Loss. This study found this form of therapy helped to reduce common occurrences of depression and anxiety while improving verbal communication in those living with Memory Loss. 
Another study published in May 2020 titled The Music Therapy in the Treatment of Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis focused on music as a treatment alternative for different stages of dementia. The report states that music therapy improved participants’ cognitive function and quality of life. 
Benefits of Music Therapy for People Living with Memory Loss
Music therapy is a common therapeutic tool used by Memory Care environments, hospitals, and various therapists. Below are some of the many benefits of this therapeutic approach. 
Improves Overall Physical and Mental Well-Being
Music has long been proven to stimulate good physical and mental health. As Memory Loss affects a person’s cognitive function and motor skills, music therapy can be used as a motivation for the brain to focus and release hormones to improve immune function. 
Helps to Express Feelings and Ideas, Verbally and Non-Verbally
Music is the universal language of love, acceptance, and community spirit. People living with Memory Loss can easily lose their ability to express ideas, thoughts, and feelings. Using music therapy as a tool, body language such as clapping, head nodding, and stomping can give those living with Memory Loss a voice. 
Improves Mood Throughout The Day
The release of dopamine is increased with the use of music. This feel-good hormone provides a happy emotion to stabilize one’s mood which in turn reduces anxiety and depression. Rhythmically focused sounds as with classical music can lower frustration while promoting relaxation. 
Leads to Better Sleep Patterns at Night
The autonomic nervous system can be stimulated with use of familiar and calming music to help reduce blood pressure, heart rhythm, and breathing rate to a comfortable level for sleeping. A study published in the International Journal of Nursing Studies discovered participants exposed to soothing music before bedtime were better rested and had a longer REM sleep than participants who did not listen to music. 
Improves Recall of Memories
Listening to a particular song or genre of music can stimulate memories of the past, both good and bad for everyone. Using music therapy to promote the use of the brain to recall times, events, and faces can connect a person living with Memory Loss with a precious memory. Music can help link a face with a name, emotion, or past event. 
Helps with Managing Stress
The Psychology Department research team at McGill University reviewed 400 published reports in the category of neurochemistry of music. They discovered not only did music work as an alternative to prescribed medication to lower levels of stress hormone cortisol, but it also improved the immune system by increasing levels of natural antibodies and killer cells. 
Encourages Physical Exercise, Dance, or Movement
As music encourages movement, using it as a therapy tool to stimulate a healthy way of life can help improve mobilization, strength, balance, and coordination. Regular movement has been shown to increase motor function while reducing the risk of falls, which is beneficial to those living with Memory Loss.

For people living with Memory Loss, this type of care is essential as it considers the unique challenges that come with this condition. Keep reading to learn why holistic care can be vital for people living with Memory Loss. 
The Importance of Holistic Care for People Living with Memory Loss
Memory Loss can affect not only a person’s cognitive abilities, but also their mental and emotional well-being. Therefore, treatment for memory loss should not be limited to medication or therapy alone. Rather, it should encompass a wide range of strategies, such as lifestyle changes, social support, and alternative therapies. This is where holistic care comes into play. Holistic care is centered around the belief that good health involves maintaining balance between physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.
Holistic Care for People Living with Memory Loss
By providing holistic care, healthcare professionals can help individuals with Memory Loss manage their symptoms and maintain a higher quality of life.
Holistic care involves integrating physical, emotional, mental, and social states to create a plan that is tailored to the individual’s specific needs. 

Physical care involves improving nutrition and exercise, which can lead to overall health benefits.
Emotional care is vital to ensure that one does not feel isolated and unsupported. 
Mental care focuses on exercises that improve cognitive function.
Social care emphasizes effective communication, building connections with family and friends. 

How Holistic Care Helps People With Memory Loss
Memory Loss affects the body in unpredictable ways, including adding to issues that can adversely affect the spirit and body of a person. Here’s how holistic care can benefit people living with Memory Loss. 

Reduces Stress and Anxiety: A physical or mental health condition can increase the amount of stress and anxiety a person living with Memory Loss must endure. Understanding their care plan can help reduce the symptoms that accompany these emotions.  
Improves Quality of Life: Whether the person living with Memory Loss requires partial or full support with daily living activities, holistic care intervention can help improve the quality of life of the person. 
Increases Overall Well-Being: Holistic care is the definition of whole-body health. By focusing on Memory Loss care that enhances the physical, mental, and emotional functions of a body, people living with Memory Loss can have better overall well-being. 

The Role of Care Partners in Providing Holistic Care
When it comes to providing holistic care, care partners play a critical role in ensuring that the person living with Memory Loss’s needs are met beyond just their physical health. Care partners work in partnership with healthcare professionals to offer support and encouragement as people living with Memory Loss navigate the complexities of their healthcare journey. 
They help to promote a sense of emotional well-being by offering comfort, companionship, and a listening ear. They also help to provide spiritual support by connecting patients with their beliefs, values, and traditions. 
Holistic Care Approaches for People Living with Memory Loss
There are various types of therapy that can improve the quality of life of people living with Memory Loss while providing overall support. 

Person-Centred Care: Part of Memory Care focuses on person-centred care. With personalized care treatments, this form of holistic care helps to enhance a person’s daily living. 
Art Therapy: Memory Loss often makes it difficult for people to express their mood, personality, and creativity. Through art therapy, a person can improve their communication skills and find a sense of pride. 
Music Therapy: Music has the tendency to boost memory recall as it can take a person back to a time of wonder and fulfillment. It can also be used to stimulate physical movement or to create a positive atmosphere. 
Reminiscence Therapy: Memory Care can involve using mementos such as movies, books, and photos to reignite precious memories that may otherwise be lost. 
Nature Therapy: A person’s physical and emotional health can be improved with participation in nature therapy, also referred to as ecotherapy. This form of therapy immerses a person in the great outdoors.

18,How to Handle Repetitive Questions from People Living with Memory Loss,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T07:04:42-05:00August 17th, 2023|Categories: Blog|"," If you are a caregiver that provides Memory Care for someone living with Memory Loss, you may find yourself answering their numerous—oftentimes repetitive—questions on a daily basis. Memory Loss, a condition where an individual [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/how-to-handle-repetitive-questions-from-people-living-with-memory-loss/,"If you are a caregiver that provides Memory Care for someone living with Memory Loss, you may find yourself answering their numerous—oftentimes repetitive—questions on a daily basis. Memory Loss, a condition where an individual experiences difficulty in recalling past events or forming new memories, can have a range of effects on a person’s behaviour. This can include the inability to retain information, difficulty performing regular daily tasks, disorientation, the inability to form words or sentences, and impaired judgement. Among these behaviours, repetitive questioning is one of the most common characteristics that affects the daily life of people living with Memory Loss.
Why Do People Living with Memory Loss Exhibit Repetitive Questioning Behaviour?
Studies indicate that the primary reason why people living with Memory Loss exhibit this behaviour is to reconstruct their memories or fill in the gaps in their recollection of events. At its core, this behaviour typically stems from a loss of recall and an inability to retain information long-term. 
As a result, individuals with Memory Loss may struggle to remember the answers to questions they have previously asked, leading them to ask the same things over and over again. Further complicating matters, they may not even be aware that they’ve asked the same questions repeatedly. 
How Should You Respond to Repetitive Questioning?
While responding to repetitive questioning, at times, can be taxing for caregivers, understanding why people with Memory Loss exhibit this behaviour is crucial to supporting them. Here are some tips to help caregivers respond with empathy, patience, and kindness.
Try to Understand Their Feeling Behind the Repetition
Take the time to understand the underlying feelings and concerns behind their repeated questions. For example, they may be seeking reassurance or trying to piece together fragmented memories. 
Try to Give Short Answers
Only respond with short answers that directly relate to their questioning. It is crucial to respond in a calm and respectable manner. This response will also help the care partner fosters trust and promote overall well-being for the person living with Memory Loss.
Try to Find Solutions for Questions Repeated Every Day
Consider the frequent questions asked daily. To help with inquiries about the date or time, place visual aids that help answer these questions in familiar areas of the home. These aids can feature voice overs for those with vision impairment. 
Distract from the Anxiety That Is Causing the Questioning
As the repetitive questioning can be caused by a form of boredom, anxiety, or uncertainty, distract the person living with Memory Loss with a favourable activity, snack, or program. Ask for their help in folding laundry or a household task they are able to perform. 
Change the Subject
For some people living with Memory Loss, their interest doesn’t lie in the topic specifically but rather in communicating in general. In certain cases, it is simply acceptable to quickly change the subject to a topic that may be more familiar or exciting for the person living with Memory Loss.
Take Them Away from Stress-Causing Situations
For times when the repetitive questioning causes undue stress or concern for the person living with Memory Loss, consider a new environment. Taking a walk, drive, or visit to a friendly and calm atmosphere can help reduce the constant questioning. 
Practice Patience and Empathy
With dementia, patience and empathy goes a long way for everyone involved. Use compassion when talking or performing tasks for the person living with Memory Loss. The biblical Golden Rule “do unto others what you would have them to you” comes in handy for care partners. 
Rely on Support from Family and Professionals
While most care partners live as if they have superpowers, it is crucial to ask for help from other family members and close friends. Many areas offer local organizations with supportive programs and trained professionals. 
Memory & Company’s Respite Care Hotel Service
If you’re looking for short-term Respite Care in Toronto or long-term dementia care in the nearby area, Memory & Company offers a VIP club-type atmosphere for those living with a form of Memory Loss. Our social, physical, and support programs are designed for the Member and their care partner.

Care partners of those living with Alzheimer’s provide support on a daily basis and assist with their daily needs. In addition, they also must consider their own needs and make time for themselves to ensure a healthy balanced lifestyle. 
The Challenges of Alzheimer’s Caregiving
A care partner of someone living with Alzheimer’s wears many hats, so to speak. The physical, mental, and emotional demands of caring for the social and physical needs of another person can be detrimental to the care partner’s health and well-being. 
With the progressive disease of Alzheimer’s, a person may need physical care for basic needs such as mobility, grooming, and personal hygiene. For some, daily living activities require partial or full assistance. 
Household chores such as cleaning, preparing meals, and cooking are also part of the daily routine for a care partner. Laundry, running errands, and attending appointments are other important tasks most care partners are required to perform.
Those living with Alzheimer’s Disease may require care partners to provide medication management support to ensure the proper medication is taken as prescribed. Other medical needs include nutritional supplements, fluid intake measurements, and special dietary needs. 
A care partner often is caring for a loved one which can involve a live-in situation. In addition to the daily living routine, a care partner is also the main entertainment for the person with Alzheimer’s Disease. Having someone around who is attentive and who is a companion can help reduce the risk of depression and isolation for those living with Memory Loss. 
The Importance of Taking a Break
For those who have ever spent any amount of time caring for another person, taking time for self-care is vital to the health and safety of all. Care partners spend time and energy to put the physical, mental, and emotional needs of the person being cared for first and above their own needs. 
The job or position of a care partner has been recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as “an important public health issue that affects the quality of life”. Their main focus of concern addresses the topic of “burnout”.
The CDC advises that without proper intervention, such as Respite Care, a care partner may experience a decline in their own physical health, a compromised immune function, high levels of anxiety and depression, and a tendency to overuse psychoactive medications. 
It is commonly known that many care partners are at risk for an early death, most times often before the death of the person they are responsible for. 
What Is Overnight Respite Care?
Overnight Respite Care refers to relief care for someone who is a care partner or provider to another person, such as a person living with Memory Loss. Overnight care is considered as short-term Respite Care wherein the term can be for one or several nights and days.
There are various forms of this type of service such nursing care, medication management, and social activities. Respite Care programs can be personalized to meet the needs and preferences of the person living with Memory Loss, so the care partner(s) is able to take full advantage of having this “time off”. 
The Benefits of Overnight Respite Care
Overnight Respite Care in at Memory & Company’s Markham and Oakville Clubs can benefit everyone involved, including the person living with Memory Loss and their care partner(s). 
First and foremost, overnight Respite Care provides peace of mind to the care partner that the person living with Memory Loss is being well cared for in their absence. Having time for rest and relaxion is important as it can help the care partner(s) “recharge” their energy and calm their mind. 
During this time of Respite Care, having access to social activities that are designed for the person in mind can be a priceless benefit. The care partner(s) can indulge in their favourite hobbies or activities that feed their mind and soul while the person living with Memory Loss enjoys time with new friends. 
Relationships with family and friends are also important to maintain while caring for someone living with Memory Loss. It is easy for caregivers to spend more time focusing on the person with Memory Loss than themselves and others in their life. Taking time to strengthen relationships can help improve a person’s mental health. 
Respite Care offers care partners the ability and time to “catch-up” on chores, errands, and personal time, appointments, and much needed vacation time that often are put on the back burner when caring for someone. Respite can be for a few hours or a few days or a few weeks. 
How Memory & Company Can Help
Memory & Company offers the world’s first Respite Hotel and Premium Day Program that provides compassionate overnight respite care for adults. With locations in Markham and Oakville, we provide an intimate environment designed to be a safe and warm space for those living with Memory Loss.

What Is [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/why-respite-care-is-the-best-choice-for-people-living-with-alzheimers-dementia-in-summer/,"For families looking for respite care in the Greater Toronto Area, the summer months may offer the best possible solutions as it is a time for vacations, school breaks, and family time.
What Is Respite Care?
Respite care is a type of care that provides temporary relief for primary caregivers who are responsible for the care of an individual who is living with a form of Memory Loss, brain injury, dementia, and/or other related health conditions.
This type of care is provided by caregivers who are capable of handling the unique needs of the individual in question and who can offer a wide range of services, including help with activities of daily living, medication management, and other specialized services.
There are various opportunities for respite care, whether it be in-home, at a Premium Day Program, or short-term or long-term accommodations at a Memory Care environment. Respite care is vital to the well-being of caregivers as it allows them to take breaks from their caregiving duties while ensuring that their loved ones continue to receive the care they require.
Reasons to Choose Respite Care in the Summer
There are many benefits to choosing respite care in the summer months, specifically in Markham and/or Oakville Memory & Company locations.
Prevent Burnout in Caregivers
The main reason to use respite care services at any time is to give the care partner(s) a much-needed break from their care responsibilities. Most care partners tend to be family members who place the care and well-being of their loved ones (those living with Memory Loss) above their own mental health and well-being. Self-care, self-worth, and relationships with family and friends tend to take a backseat, leading to caregiver burnout.
Relief from Caregiving Duties
Life can become a blur with work, household chores, errands, appointments, and other commitments. Taking care of another person can add to the stress and pressure of everyday life. Respite care helps to improve the mental and emotional well-being of the care partner(s) and the loved one receiving care. Everyone needs a new environment, conversation, and social interactions with different people and respite care can provide that.
Handle Summer Health Stress
On the surface, summer health stress is a strange concept for most people. For care partners, the expectation of family and friends to spend time together, take vacations, and get the most out of the warm summer months can add to the present stress of caring for another person.
Access Memory Care with Short-Term & Long-Term Stays
Summer is a busy time for indoor/outdoor activities at short-term and long-term Memory Care environments. There is often more family and friends visiting, guest speakers, and excursions that serve as a great welcoming for those wondering about a future move to a Memory Care environment.
Assistance with Activities of Daily Living
A Memory Care environment offers professional care for the person with Alzheimer’s Disease or other forms of dementia. Whether the person requires 24/7 care and supervision or basic assistance with daily living activities, these environments are designed with the physical structure and programs that are needed.
Increased Socialization
By providing a temporary break for caregivers, respite care allows individuals in need of care to explore new social opportunities outside of their routine environment. This break can encourage individuals to engage with peers and participate in activities that promote social skills and overall well-being.
Get Awesome Dining Experiences
Respite care can be considered a mini vacation for both the person living with Memory Loss and their care partner(s). What’s a vacation without delicious (and nutritious) food? With a reputable Memory Care environment, the meals provided are prepared by an executive chef using only the freshest ingredients.
Ward Off Those Summer Blues
Respite care can provide a safe and comfortable environment for people living with Memory Loss, giving them a change of scenery and the opportunity to socialize with others. This can help ward off feelings of isolation, hopelessness, and depression. It can also be a great way for them to participate in summer activities and events that may not be possible at home.
Access to Superior Programming
Respite care from a team of professionals can give you peace of mind knowing that your loved one who is living with Alzheimer’s, or another forms of dementia, is receiving the proper care. The social programs are specialized and customized to ensure everyone benefits from the respite care.

Why You Should Try a Long-Term Stay in the Summer?

Summer is also the time when most people plan social gatherings and get outside to enjoy some Vitamin D (an activity that’s great for people living with Memory Loss).

For those living with Memory Loss, socialization is even more important for their mental, emotional, and physical health. The brain can be physically affected by social isolation, especially when it is an ongoing challenge. Below, we discuss to power of socialization for both people living with Memory Loss and their care partners. 
Benefits of Socialization for People with Memory Loss
Socialization can mean many things to different people. For those living with Memory Loss, the ability to properly communicate with others, even their care partners or spouses, is an important aspect to having self-worth and self-confidence. 
Mental Stimulation
Socialization can help with mental stimulation. This can include holding a conversation, playing a card game, or attending a hobby class. 
Improved Mood and Emotional Well-Being
The overwhelming feeling of isolation can be lifted with socialization opportunities. Having something to focus on can brighten a person’s mood and improve their emotional well-being. 
Increased Cognitive Abilities
Memory Loss affects the functions of the brain for communication, intellect, and the ability to perform reasoning. Maintaining an active brain through socialization can help increase cognitive abilities. 
Positive Impact on Physical Health
Research has found a link between socialization activities and a person’s physical health. Our minds are stimulated by physical movement. 
Reduced Risk of Further Memory Loss
Increasing the brain activity can help to slow down the progress of Memory Loss. Simple mental and physical activities encourage the brain to function and be challenged. 
Strategies to Encourage Socialization for People Living with Memory Loss
Regardless of the level of Memory Loss, there are strategies to try to encourage socialization for those living with Memory Loss. This condition can cause a person to withdraw from society due to embarrassment and/or shame in relation to their forgetfulness. 
Create a Supportive Environment
When it comes to Memory Loss and Alzheimer Care, it is important to form a circle of support within the environment of the person living with Memory Loss. This can be seen with discussions with close family and friends who have regular contact. 
Encourage Participation in Social Activities
Participation in social activities can be met by resistance by the person living with Memory Loss. Introducing your loved one to programs in our Premium Day Program for just 4 hours weekly to start, can help them get used to social activities and programs in a safe, supportive and judgement-free environment.  
Find Appropriate Social Opportunities
It is vital the appropriate social opportunity is sought as not every activity will be beneficial to the person living with Memory Loss. Base these opportunities on activities that present a positive outcome without causing undue stress or anxiety. 
Facilitate Communication During Socialization
Be alert for any signs of withdrawal from the conversation. People living with Memory Loss may need a moment to collect their thoughts or they may need someone to help in their communication. 
Supporting Socialization for People with Memory Loss
Memory Loss and other Memory Care requires support from many different sources.
The Role of Family Members and Caregivers
As loving family members, close friends, and care partners, it can be hard to step back and allow the person living with Memory Loss to perform daily tasks. As long as there is no potential harm or risk to dangerous situations, it’s important to support and encourage the person to continue performing tasks independently to enhance their self-esteem and preserve their dignity. 
Resources Available to Support Socialization
With Respite for Alzheimer’s care partners, there are resources to assist in the caring for those living with Memory Loss.

Whether a person living with Memory Loss is being cared for at home or in a Memory Care environment, respect and compassion must play a role in the day-to-day care provided. 
To enhance the life of a person living with Memory Loss, there are several tips and techniques Care Partners should follow.  
Set a Positive Mood for Interaction
It is vital to maintain a positive mood during all physical and verbal interactions with a person living with Memory Loss. Be aware of facial expressions, attitude, body language, and tone of voice. Walking into the room with a smile can help set the tone each time. 
Speak Slowly in a Reassuring Tone
Frustration, confusion, and sometimes fear are all considered to be symptoms of dementia. Being patient and take the time to explain yourself and reassure your loved one is important to help show compassion and respect to the person living with Memory Loss. 
Monitor Medications
As prescribed medication is to be administered on a strict schedule, the Care Partner(s) must follow a routine. A person living with Memory Loss may need assistance with administration and monitoring in regard to the type and time of medication to be taken. Also people living with Memory Loss need their medications reviewed regularly as their disease progresses.   Talk to you doctor if you are finding the medications are causing falls, increased confusion, over sedation, or are no longer being effective for their needs. 
Focus on Mealtimes
Nutrition is important to support a healthy lifestyle, including mental stability. Memory Loss brings challenges in respect to the need and desire to eat regular meals. The brain requires balanced nutrition with a focus on green leafy vegetables, fish, whole grains, and berries.  
Create a Safe Environment
As Memory Loss can cause confusion, disorientation, and wandering, it is vital to create a safe living environment. Support Memory Care by installing safety features such as railings, outlet covers, bathroom bars, stair grips, avoiding carpets and rugs that present trip hazards and cabinet latches. 
Create a Routine for Daily Chores
To help slow down the cognitive progression of Memory issues, following a routine each day may help. Having set times for bathing, grooming, eating, exercising, and administrating medication provides a good routine for everyone. 
Keep Them Physically and Mentally Active
Physical health is important for everyone as being active is good for the heart, muscles, joints, and even the brain. Physical fitness helps improve blood flow to support good mental health and physical health, which is also crucial to those living with Memory Loss. 
Use Expert Tips to Manage Challenging Behaviours
Those living with Memory Loss might find it difficult to express their feelings, needs, and wants. This can lead to responsive behaviours. While some people may not exhibit challenging behaviours, brain functions can change as the condition progresses. 
Have Them Help with Familiar Activities

25,Debunking Common Myths about Dementia,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T06:57:49-05:00March 21st, 2023|Categories: Blog|"," When it comes to long-term care or short-term Respite Care, there are many Dementia myths that can hinder the support opportunities people living with Memory Loss need.  Learning the truths about dementia can diminish [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/debunking-myths-about-dementia/,"When it comes to long-term care or short-term Respite Care, there are many Dementia myths that can hinder the support opportunities people living with Memory Loss need. 
Learning the truths about dementia can diminish the stigma associated with the condition. Keep reading for 12 Dementia myths debunked. 
Myth #1: Dementia Is a Disease
Dementia is actually a collection of symptoms that affect the functioning of the brain. From communication issues, language difficulties, and memory problems, dementia can have an adverse effect on daily living activities. 
Myth #2: Only Older Adults Develop Dementia
As a progressive degenerative brain condition, dementia is more commonly seen in those over the age of 65; however, men and women as young as 30 have been diagnosed with the degenerative condition. 
Myth #3: If Someone in Your Family Has Dementia, It Means You Will Get It as Well
While there are forms of dementia that hold a genetic factor, there is no scientific proof that every generation of a person with dementia will also have symptoms. 
Myth #4: Dementia Is a Mental Illness
Dementia affects brain function, but it is not classified as a mental illness. This myth may exist due to the fact that dementia is a condition of the brain, affecting some people’s ability to think, speak, and function. 
Myth #5: Dementia Isn’t Treatable
While there is no cure for dementia, there are treatment methods available to help with various symptoms. These forms of therapy can include lifestyle coping strategies and prescribed medication. 
Myth #6: Dementia and Alzheimer’s Are the Same
Dementia is a general term used to describe a group of symptoms associated with a decline in cognitive functioning. Alzheimer’s Disease is a specific disease that is diagnosed by a healthcare professional. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia. 
Myth #7: Dementia Is Always Preventable
Unfortunately, dementia is not preventable. Research suggests there are several factors that increase the risk for the development of the condition. These can include (but are not limited to) hypertension, obesity, smoking, diabetes, brain trauma, and excessive alcohol consumption. 
Myth #8: Vitamins and Supplements Can Prevent Dementia
As stated, there is no one magic treatment to prevent dementia. It is vital to support a healthy brain and body by having sufficient amounts of vitamins and minerals, whether that’s via supplemental means or natural, regardless of signs of dementia. 
Myth #9: People with Dementia Can’t Remember Anything
Types of dementia symptoms can impede the ability to remember details of recent and past events; however, not all memories are robbed. In most cases, the later stages of dementia can cause memories to fade progressively. Each person’s ability to maintain memories varies from one person to another. 
Myth #10: Dementia Is a Natural Part of Aging
Dementia is NOT a normal part of aging. Although we all may experience some memory recall challenges from time to time. Dementia is a loss of cognitive functioning that interferes with quality of life and activities. 
The biggest risk factor for dementia is age—the older you are the more likely you are to develop the condition, but it is not an inevitable part of ageing. About two in 100 people aged between 65 to 69 have dementia, and this figure rises to one in five for those aged between 85 to 89.
Myth #11: People with Dementia Are Violent
It is important to understand that not every person living with dementia becomes violent. Various forms of dementia are known to see changes in the behaviour, and personality of some people, depending on the areas of the brain affected. The frustration of continuously being confused, fear, changes to rationalization and reasoning abilities and the inability to communicate physical or emotional needs can see some people lash out in anger. It is best to educate caregivers on communicating with a person living with dementia to help decrease the risk of violence and aggression.     
Myth #12:  Forgetfulness Is the Only Early Sign of Dementia
As with most medical conditions, there is not one early sign to indicate a particular illness, disease, or affliction. Dementia is associated with forgetfulness as it is a common symptom of most forms of Dementia. If a person’s daily living is being affected by Memory Loss, it is important to discuss this with a physician.

Whether you need [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/process-for-moving-into-memory-care-setting/,"As a care partner for someone living with Memory Loss, it is crucial to create a seamless transition to a Memory Care setting when the time comes. 
Why Choose Memory Care?
Whether you need long-term open-ended stay or short-term Respite Care, Memory Care environments offer physical, mental, and emotional support programs for the person living with Memory Loss and for their care partner(s).
Moving is stressful for anyone at any stage of life. For those living with Memory Loss, a move can be confusing and overwhelming. Below are some steps to help ease the transition to a Memory Care environment. 
Steps to Take When You Are Preparing for a Move
Have a Conversation with Other Family Members First
Every member of the family that has an active role in caring for the person living with Memory Loss should be consulted. 
Determine What Level of Care Is Needed
Memory care encompasses a range of conditions and needs, including Alzheimer and related dementia’s Care. Talk to the medical specialists that work with your loved one to learn the level of care that will be needed. 
Do Your Research
It is important to choose a Memory Care environment that offers the best care and opportunities for your loved one. Research the care plans, security, policies, amenities, and available programs, therapies, and supports. 
Take Advantage of Transition Programs
Memory Care environments that offer day programming to help not only the person living with Memory Loss but their care partners as well with the transition by building trust and relationships. That way the Memory Care environment is familiar and comfortable.
Try to Keep Your Loved One Away from the Chaos of Moving
While it is important to discuss the move with the person living with Memory Loss, it may be too overwhelming for them to fully understand what is happening. Informing the perswon living with Memory Loss is best reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Speak with the homes knowledgeable team to learn the best approach for that individual.   It is easier to remove the person living with memory loss, and pack items while they are distracted and have the room and their belongings set-up prior to their arrival to make setting in easier.  
Communicate with the Team Members
Become familiar with the Team Members responsible for the care of the person living with Memory Loss. Inquire about any transition support, access to your loved one, and communication systems. 
Check the Availability of Appropriate Healthcare
A reputable Memory Loss environment will have an onsite healthcare section including lab services, emergency care, and pharmaceutical services. 
Check Activities and Amenities
Investigate the activities and amenities offered at the new Memory Care setting. There will be a wide range of Memory care programs that can rekindle a past interest in a hobby or skill, or introduce new and meaningful programs.   
Prepare All Documents
Ensure all key documents are in order. It is important to include a list of medications, medical insurance coverage, and legal documentation such as Power of Attorney and/or a Living Will. It is also important to complete all required documentation of the Memory Care setting to ensure as smooth of a transition.   Provide the most up to date care information.   
Pack Intentionally
At any age, a person can gather precious tokens, art, bedding, and clothing that ignite a happy memory. Pack the items needed as well as a few that bring them to a special time in their life. Do not overpack, be selective of what the person living with Memory Loss values at the current time.   Over cluttering the room can become overwhelming and can pose safety risks.   Keep it simple.  Also take into account that items do go missing in Memory Care settings due to progression of the disease.  High value items should not go to the Memory Care setting.  
Determine the Cost of the Memory Care Home
Memory Care is a viable arrangement to provide the best care for your loved one. Costs of Memory Care services may vary depending on the type of care provided, staffing levels and type of staff, and environment provided. 
Steps to Take on Moving Day
Remain Calm and Positive on Move-In Day
A positive and calm environment can help to ease fears and uncertainties. Keep an upbeat mood to encourage excitement regardless of how you may be feeling. 
Take Care of the Person Living with Memory Loss
Moving day for anyone can be overwhelming. Be sure to pay attention to the body language of the person living with Memory Loss and react accordingly with comfort and support. 
Determine the Floor Layout and Furniture Needs
Most Memory Care environments allow Members to bring in a few favourite pieces such as a chair or specialized bed.. 
Sort Your Loved One’s Belongings
The person living with Memory Loss may recognize a few pieces of their precious belongings. Have these items set in the room before they arrive as a welcoming comfort. 
Put Together a Move-In Box
In the days leading up to the move-in day, collect some of your loved one’s favourite treats and items that may bring comfort. 
Make the New Environment as Homely as Possible
Decorate the private living quarters with precious photos, blankets, and ornaments. The room should resemble the environment they have a familiarity with, despite their Memory Loss. 
Steps to Take After Moving Into Memory Care
Encourage Your Loved One to Socialize And Participate
Encourage your loved one to participate and socialize in various clubs and activities hosted by the Team Members. Suggest that your loved one join a class of their favourite hobby. 
Ask How They’re Feeling About Their Transition
In the days and months after the move, continue to inquire how your loved one is feeling about their new home. 
Participate In Day Programs
Participate in day programs at the Memory Care environment to support and encourage your loved one’s participation.

27,Important Questions to Ask Before Moving Into a Memory Care Environment,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T06:49:45-05:00January 31st, 2023|Categories: Blog|"," If you are in the process of searching for a suitable Memory Care environment or Respite Care environment for your loved one living with Memory Loss, there are a few things to keep in [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/questions-to-ask-before-moving-into-memory-care-environment/,"If you are in the process of searching for a suitable Memory Care environment or Respite Care environment for your loved one living with Memory Loss, there are a few things to keep in mind. Not every Memory Care environment offers the same services and not every place provides specialized Memory Care. 
So, how do you know which one is right for your loved one? You ask questions. You ask a lot of questions. 
Below, we have compiled a list of you should ask when looking into Memory Care.
Who Makes Up Your Care Team?
One of the first questions to ask is what staffing is onsite at the Memory Care environment. Having a team that includes a Director of Care, visiting physicians, licensed nurses, personal support workers, recreation therapists and other specialty trained staff ensures the physical, emotional, and mental health of Members are always addressed. 
What Are Your Staffing Ratios?
By asking what ratios are available during day and nighttime hours is important to understand the level of care that is being provided.  High staffing ratios of at least 7 Clients: 1 Staff Member is needed to ensure that people living with Memory Loss get the time and attention they need.   
What Medical Services Are Available?
Some environments provide onsite visiting physician offices, pharmacies, podiatry care, optometrists, dental hygenists, physical and occupational therapy, massage and even lab services. Ask about the specialized services offered. 
What Type of Dementia Techniques Is Used?
Reputable Memory Care environments have a set of polices and procedures in respect to working and responding with people living with Memory Loss. Ask about the physical and social techniques used in various scenarios. 
What Type of Training Do Team Members Have?
Team Members should have specialized training and education related to dementia. From behavioral challenges to mobility and emotional struggles, Team Members should be able to react and respond with appropriate actions. 
What Types of Accommodations Are Available?
Ask if the living arrangements are private or shared. With long-term accommodations, discuss whether the Memory Care environment can accommodate your loved one if they experience changes with their health or cognitive function and for how long. 
Are the Buildings and Grounds Secured?
The inside of the building should offer well-lit hallways, motion sensors, and call buttons. The outer walkways, gardens, and seating areas should be well-maintained with security measures to ensure no one wanders away. 
Is the Atmosphere Warm and Friendly?
First impressions are everything, particularly when it comes to scouting for a new living space. Is the Memory Care environment clean and organized? Do you feel comfortable and welcomed upon entering? 
Are the Members Clean and Well-Groomed?
Take note when having a guided tour on the appearance and actions of the Members. Are they engaged in with others? Do they appear to be well cared for in their hygiene and other grooming matters? 
What Memory Care Activities Are Included?
Ask about the options available and what form of assistance is available for each person living with Memory Loss. Scheduled activities are usually customized to accommodate various abilities. Ask to see an activity calendar and look to see during your tour if the Members look engaged.  
Are Fitness and Wellness Programs Offered?
Ask if there are physical fitness programs tailored to the abilities and mobility of individual Members of the Memory Care environment. Light therapy, art therapy, and music therapy can help initiate and enhance a person’s abilities. 
Does the Community Offer Pet or Reminiscence Therapy?
Two common interactions for people living with Memory Loss is pet therapy and reminiscence therapy. Ask if there is a local organization that brings trained animals to the Memory Care environment on a regular basis. 
Are Any Special Events or Holiday Celebrations Held Throughout the Year?
Find out which holidays are observed and how Members at the Memory Care environment can participate. Also ask if any special events are planned on a weekly or monthly basis. 
How Many Meals or Snacks Are Provided Each Day?
This can be a huge factor in determining if the person living with Memory Loss will receive proper care as the Memory Care environment should provide at least three meals each day with two to three separate snack times. Also look to see if specialized diets are provided if needed, and if there is a chef on-site preparing the food.  
What Kinds of Beverages Are Included?
While it may be assumed that tea, coffee, juice, and water are part of meal plans, it’s better to ask now. Ask about the beverages available and if there are any alcoholic beverages served or available for additional purchase or can be stored for the Member. 
Are Meals Covered by a Nutrition Plan?
Doctors and nutritionists understand the connection between food and Memory Loss. It is imperative that any meals provided are designed to provide proper nutrition. Ask if individual plans are available for those following specialized diets. 
Can Family/Friends Join Their Loved Ones for Meals?
Memory Care environments have specific regulations and policies that must be adhered to by Team Members, Members, and visitors, especially at mealtimes. Ask if any guidelines are in place with family and friends visiting. 
What Are the Basic Costs and What Is Covered?
We cannot put a price on receiving the best care for our loved ones living with Memory Loss; however, it bears the question, how much? Ensure you understand ALL the fees.  
Ask how often a bath/shower is included in the basic fees
Ask if medication administration is an additional fee?
Do You Offer Housekeeping/Laundry Services?
Most people living with Memory Loss may need assistance with housekeeping duties and laundry. Ask if any of these services are available and if these services are on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. 
Do You Have Any Additional Locations?
If the existing location you are considering is out of town or quite a distance away from the family members of the person living with Memory Loss, the owners may have another place to consider. 
Do You Have Spa/Salon Services?
Ask if there are any salon and/or spa facilities onsite. If not, ask if there is a visiting service or transportation provided to a local establishment.

Those living with Memory Loss can transition to a new place with new people with the right support. Here are some helpful tips. 
Participate in Activities of Daily Living by Helping Others
Participating in activities of daily living (ADL’s) that focus on helping others can help maintain self-esteem and sense of being. Helping with recreational activities, preparing snacks, and greeting guests can help return a bit of normalcy to their day. 
Join Local Groups or Clubs
Short-term respite care is a chance for the care partner to tend to other life responsibilities or to engage in some self-care. Memory Care environments offer clubs and groups that encourage those living with Memory Loss to meet new faces and experience socialization. 
Participate in Games
Whether it be physical fitness games, card games, or board games, people living with a form of Memory Loss benefit from mental and physical stimulation. Join in games that are catered towards the particular needs of the participants. 
Organize a Small Party to Introduce Yourself
Memory Care is designed to promote socialization, improve memory skills, and help maintain a good quality of life. To prevent isolation with newcomers, having an introductory party or gathering with food and drinks is a fun and viable solution.  
Set Your Own Pace
People living with Memory Loss may need time to adjust to their new surroundings, especially if the move is to long-term memory care. 
Stay Active
Those living with Memory Loss should be encouraged to take advantage of all of the physical programs involved in the Memory Care environment.  
Partner with Senior Living Staff and Administration

Symptoms tend to progress slowly over time for most people living with Alzheimer’s while others appear to experience symptoms at a much faster rate depending on their age and diagnosis.
Below, we discuss some common symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease so you can help your loved one who is living with Memory Loss find the support they need. 
Challenges with Solving Problems
Problem-solving is often needed to complete tasks even in the simplest form. From paying bills and balancing a checkbook to following a recipe, dementia can create challenges. 
Misplaced Items
While misplacing your car keys or smartphone is a common event for most people, those with Alzheimer’s disease seem to have this problem on a regular basis. Items are often misplaced or put in strange places, such as keys in the freezer, or hearing aids put in napkins in boxes.  
Asking Questions Repetitively
A significant symptom of dementia conditions includes repeatedly asking the same questions over and over. It may be a situation where the question is repeated several times over the span of a day or may be repeated within minutes or even seconds. 
Confusion with Time or Place
Confusion of time or place can mean disorientation or confusion of familiar surroundings as well as the calendar day, month, year, and season.
Changes in Mood and Personality
Alzheimer’s disease may affect a person’s ability to control their mood, especially if they are not in familiar surroundings or become easily confused. The personality of someone with dementia can change over time to one not recognized by close family members. 
Forgetting Information
We rely on information to live each day and perform everyday activities such as how to cook food, how to prepare for weather conditions when travelling, and remembering medical appointments. Dementia can impair the ability to remember important information. It is when you forget you are forgetting that it becomes an issue.   
Difficulty Handling Complex Tasks
With complex tasks, a person living with Alzheimer’s disease may face difficulty, even if the activity is a familiar one. Using technology, maintaining a relationship, banking, and solving problems are common tasks that require precise thought processing. 
Poor Judgment, Leading to Bad Decisions
This same thought process, or lack of it, can create poor judgement when making decisions. Many people living with dementia or other Memory Loss conditions have also had a difficult time hygiene, money management, and exposure to physical harm. Rationalization and reasoning are seriously affected by people living with Memory Loss.  
Taking Longer to Complete Normal Daily Tasks
For people living with Memory Loss, daily tasks such as cooking, cleaning, grooming, and washing dishes or clothes may take longer than deemed necessary by others. With the misconception of time, space, and familiarity, tasks may be done slower or at subpar levels than prior to their Memory Loss.  
Problems with Words in Speaking or Writing
Following or holding a conversation or putting words to paper may become difficult for many people living with Memory Loss. From repeating words, to forgetting what word to use, the language becomes easily lost. Many people living with Memory Loss will also mistake items with other words or have difficulty with word finding.

If you are searching for long-term care or short-term respite care, talk to the compassionate team at Memory & Company. We specialize in Memory Care for people living with Memory Loss all while supporting their care partners.  Contact us today to discuss how we can help you along this journey.

30,What to Consider When Searching for Memory Care,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T06:43:50-05:00November 8th, 2022|Categories: Blog|"," Memory Care can be a form of support for care partners who are caring for a person living with Memory Loss. Whether the Memory Loss is due to a diagnosis of dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease, [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/consider-when-searching-for-memory-care/,"Memory Care can be a form of support for care partners who are caring for a person living with Memory Loss. Whether the Memory Loss is due to a diagnosis of dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease, or Memory Impairment due to a brain injury, this form of specialized care can be offered as in-home Memory Care or at a Memory Care environment. 
When looking for Memory Care for your loved one living with Memory Loss, here are some factors to consider. 
Familiar with Alzheimer’s and Dementia
Protecting the best interests of your loved one living with Memory Loss can be accomplished by selecting an environment that focuses on those with Alzheimer’s and dementia conditions and does not make memory care an afterthought in their design and planning. Ask questions about the type of care provided and the extent of care given. Factors to consider include whether they have highly trained and qualified Team Members, the ratio of Team Members to Members, and the form of support given. 
Knowledgeable and Well-Trained Team Members
Family members who become care partners for a loved one who is living with Memory Loss have all of the best intentions. But even qualified personnel need support and help from time to time. The physical, emotional, and mental trauma those living with Memory Loss face requires specific care and services. Choose a Memory Care environment where Team Members have the experience and knowledge of Memory Loss conditions. Look for specialized training in behaviour management, care approaches, quality engagement training for this population, and training on how to connect in meaningful ways with people living with dementia.  
Clean and Well Maintained
Have a first-hand look at the selected environment to gain an understanding of the importance of cleanliness to Team Members. Dirty floors, unpleasant odours, and cluttered hallways can be a sign of a less-than-average maintained environment. On the other hand, a sterile environment with no welcoming or personal décor can also be a red flag. 
Style and Presentation of the Environment
A safe and supportive environment should have the comforts of home with the appropriate equipment and design to keep those living with Memory Loss safe. Nursing care facilities resemble a hospital setting while Memory Care environments should be warm and engaging with plenty of natural light in common spaces. The style of the building should provide accessibility by mobility devices, be designed with dementia design principles in mind. 
Team AssociatesCan Address All Concerns and Questions
A face-to-face meeting with Team Members and a tour of the Memory Care environment can determine the level of care and service your loved one who is living with Memory Loss can expect. The decision to utilize the services of, or move to, a Memory Care environment can pose new questions and concerns for both you and your loved one. 
Secure Perimeter to Prevent Members from Wandering
People living with Memory Loss often wander or become lost or confused about their location. When this happens, it’s referred to as “wandering” or “exit seeking”. Make sure the Memory Care environment has the proper security features to prevent wandering and ensure the physical safety of your loved one. Motion sensors, door alarms, security cameras, and location devices are offered by some Memory Care environments. Also look for environments that offer a circular environment that does not have dead end hallways. This allows people who tend to wander to explore their space without the frustration of reaching a dead-end corridor.  
Access to Medical Care or Nursing
Memory Care environments may be designed and structured with a home-like setting but should have adequate medical support. Ensure qualified nurses and allied health professionals are available on-site with access to physicians, pharmacists, and medical specialists when needed. 
Price of the Memory Care Environment
In theory and in practice, it can be said the price for the care and general well-being of a loved one living with Memory Loss is worth it’s weight in gold. Yet this is a major factor why some care partners choose to try to provide all levels of service and care for their loved one on their own. That said, many Memory Care environments cost a fraction of what it would cost to hire in-home care partners, with highly trained team Members that truly understand the needs of people living with memory loss.
Purposeful and Engaging Activities
While day programs and short-term stays may be offered for those living with Memory Loss as a form of respite care for the care partner, there should be purposeful and engaging activities. Socialization is an important component of supporting those living with Memory Loss. The care plan should involve activities that may delay cognitive decline, address loneliness, and stimulate communication.  Look for environments that offer seamless programming throughout the day, with engaged team members always available to offer programs and acitivities.  
Memory Care or Respite Hotel Location
It is important for the care partner and family and friends of the person living with Memory Loss to have easy access to the Memory Care environment. Regular visits and interactions are crucial to the mental health of both the care partner and the person living with Memory Loss, regardless of their level of Memory Loss. 
Nutritious Meals and “Brain Foods”
Poor nutrition can have an adverse effect on those living with Memory Loss. This condition can cause some to neglect having three meals a day, whether they are unable to prepare it themselves or completely forget to eat. The food choices and dining room structure should adapt to the needs and comfort of the people living with Memory Loss. 
Enjoyable Amenities
Those living with Memory Loss can face challenges of various degrees. Their condition should not limit their ability to enjoy amenities at the Memory Care environment. With strategical design and planning, there should be specialized equipment, materials, and rooms to physically support participation in ongoing activities. 
Choose Memory & Company’s Respite Hotel Service for Memory Care
In Oakville and Markham, Memory & Company offers Respite Hotels and personalized programming for those living with Memory Loss. We provide accommodations for short-term and long-term stays along with a Premium Day Program. Our services focus on the journey of both the care partner and the person living with Memory Loss.

With all of the love and best intentions in the world, caring for another person 24/7, regardless of their physical and mental condition, can be overwhelming and lonely.
One study under the Manitoba Centre for Nursing and Health Research found there is a global need for respite services. Based on evidence collected, it was shown that these services can help reduce the physical, emotional, and mental stress of care partners while promoting sensory stimulation for the person living with Memory Loss.
What Is Respite Care?
When care partners need a break from the physical and emotional demands of caring for a loved one living with Memory loss, or any illness for that matter, respite care can provide much-needed relief. Respite care can take many forms, from in-home services that allow care partners to take a break while still remaining in the home, to short-term stays in Memory Care environments or other care homes.
In some cases, respite care may even be covered by insurance. No matter what form it takes, respite care can give care partners the opportunity to recharge and return to their caregiving duties refreshed and rejuvenated.
The Importance of Respite Care
Why is respite care important? For those close to the situation, the answer is evident. It provides an avenue for care partners to re-energize, refresh, and attend to their own stress or negative emotions without affecting the person they are caring for. When care partners are well-rested, they will be able to provide better care for their loved ones. Below are some reasons why respite care is important.
Provides Relief and Time to Reset
Caring for a person living with Memory Loss is time-consuming and leaves little room for personal enjoyments or proper sleep. Memory Loss has no set schedule or clock and individuals living with Memory Loss often need round the clock attention. Having respite care provides the care partner a chance to rest their minds and bodies, whether that takes the form of uninterrupted sleep, a meditation class, or even a leisurely walk.
Provides a Welcome Change
Respite care can be beneficial to both the care partner and the person living with Memory Loss. Day after day both individuals are, for the most part, in a routine that can become monotonous. For the care partner, having to perform the same tasks and repeat answers can weigh on their emotional and physical state, leading to caregiver burnout. Having a change of pace in the daily activities once in a while can give the care partner and the person living with Memory Loss a welcome change.
Offers a New Perspective
Caring for another person is a full-time job, and much like other jobs, having a fresh pair of eyes can be beneficial to the care partner and the person living with Memory Loss. Respite care at a specialized centre is provided by trained professionals who have experience and knowledge in Memory Loss. Through hands-on social and mental programs, the person living with Memory Loss experiences new routines and activities. From this, the care partner also learns new techniques that can enhance care for their loved one.
Gives the Care Partner Renewed Energy
Regardless of the physical and mental condition of the person living with Memory Loss, the care partner needs to maintain their own mental and physical energy for proper care. Having respite care provides an avenue for the care partner to renew and recharge their own energy. Whether this time is spent resting, reading a book, or another activity, it is crucial to take the time to prevent caregiver burnout.
Improves Care Partner’s Quality of Life
Proper rest and recharging the body and mind can help improve the quality of life of the care partner. The physical, mental, and emotional stress caring for another person can have serious effects on a person’s health. If the person living with Memory Loss requires assistance, the physical strain on a care partner can be determinantal to their own body. Respite care provides support and assistance in various ways for the care partner to have a much-needed break from the physical demands of the person living with Memory Loss.
Less Chance of Hospital Patient Readmission
Living with Memory Loss can produce health challenges with many individuals requiring a form of hospitalization with the illness. Upon release from a medical setting, the individual may need extra care and time for recovery of their illness. This added pressure and stress can cause undue strain on the care partner. Respite care may help support the care partner and the person living with Memory Loss by offering in-home services or specialized programs at a Memory Care environment.
Caregivers Get Time to Engage in Other Relationships
Respite care provides the opportunity for the care partner to spend time with family and friends in a more relaxed atmosphere. This is a benefit for those who spend the bulk of their time focused on the care of another person. Care partners can schedule regular respite care for date nights, weekly social gatherings with friends, or to participate in hobbies.

32,Coping with a Dementia or Alzheimer’s Diagnosis,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T06:43:03-05:00October 11th, 2022|Categories: Blog|"," If you or your loved one has recently been diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease, you may be wondering how to cope with this new reality.

No two diagnoses are the same, so it’s likely that your experience may differ from that of someone else. 
The one thing to know is that there is help. Help from family, friends, the medical community, and support programs. We hope this article is one place to start if you’re looking for helpful ways to cope with a dementia or Alzheimer’s diagnosis. 
Accept the Diagnosis and Related Emotions
With a dementia diagnosis, it is important to accept all the emotions related to it. The person living with dementia may experience shock, denial, anger, frustration, hopelessness, or even despair. Close family members and friends may also share similar feelings. Deal with the emotions as they come before making any decisions. There is help and support, but first the mind and the heart require attention. 
Learn More About Dementia/Alzheimer’s and How It Affects the Person’s Life
With a diagnosis of any form of dementia, it is important to learn about the particular disease or condition. Like many forms of Memory Loss, there can be various stages and levels that can affect the person differently. Talk to physicians, nurses, specialists, and various supportive organizations to learn more about Memory Loss and how to cope.  
Reach Out to Loved Ones for Support
Memory Loss should not be a solo journey. Reach out to family, friends, and local support groups. A dementia or Alzheimer’s diagnosis can create a cloud of loneliness, fear, shame, or anxiety, to the person receiving the diagnosis and their loved ones. It is now more important than ever that those involved need the love, support, and strength of others to lean on whenever possible. 
Talk to Other People Who Were Diagnosed
Knowledge is power and when it comes to Memory Loss, talking to others who share in a similar experience can be very helpful. Contact a local dementia or local Alzheimer’s organization to seek support groups of those diagnosed with a form of Memory Loss. 
Engage with People
For many people with Memory Loss, forgetting names and faces and word finding difficulty is a terrifying, frustrating and embarrassing experience. Staying socially active in local groups, clubs, and events can help maintain or improve cognitive function. If a large group gathering is overwhelming, try participating in more intimate gatherings with close family and friends. 
Keep the Mind Stimulated
We may not be able to regain the Memory Loss, but there are ways to continue to strengthen the brain cells in hopes of slowing down the progression of the disease. Encourage engagement in simple household tasks, games, and hobbies such as music, art, and mind and body exercises. Learning new hobbies can also help stimulate memory cells. 
Eat and Sleep Well
While maintaining a nutritious diet is important for good physical health, it can also help to protect the brain. Look for mind healthy foods rich in antioxidants. Foods high in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sugars can increase inflammation and hinder cell communication. In addition to good eating, our bodies and our brain require quality sleep patterns to better protect our health. 
Manage Stress and Exercise
For those living with Memory Loss, the ability to “voice” their concerns waiver as can the ability to directly deal with stressors. Teaching relaxation and meditation techniques to the person living with Memory Loss is one avenue. Maintaining a regular exercise routine is another as exercise stimulates the brain and increases blood flow. 
Plan for Future Help
Some people living with Memory Loss can maintain independent living in the early stages of dementia or Alzheimer’s, while others require specialized care and support with a diagnosis. Plan for the future by understanding the physical, mental, and emotional needs of a person living with Memory Loss as the disease progresses. Prepare support for financial, healthcare, and legal needs before difficult decisions are to be made to ensure their wishes are honoured. 
Look Into Home Care Services
Living with Memory Loss can be lonesome for the individual affected and their Care Partner(s). There are local, provincial, and federal programs, organizations, and businesses that focus on the needs and support of those involved with any form of Memory Loss. Home care services are available to assist in all stages of Memory Loss.  
Join Day Programs
There are specialized Day Programs at selected Memory Loss Environments designed to slow down the progression of the Memory Loss through social activities, therapies and programs. With music, art, and pet therapies certified Team Members work with those living with Memory Loss to stimulate the brain and assist in slowing Memory Loss. 
Manage Food If You Stay Alone
Skipping meals can be a common issue with people living with Memory Loss. For some, it may relate to forgetting to eat while others may not have the proper nutritious foods on-hand or may not be able to prepare a meal. There is also risk of eating expired food, or underprepared foods that should be considered for safety.  There are meal delivery programs to help ensure one receives proper nutrition. If safety is a concerns when it comes to meal management, home care, or assisted environments may be needed. 
Check-In to a Memory Care Environment
One of the greatest support services for people living with Memory Loss and their Care Partners is Respite Hotels and retirement homes specializing in Memory Care. Dealing with Memory Loss can be overwhelming, frustrating, and confusing. A Memory Care Environment provides a safe space to talk, enjoy social activities, and receive physical, mental, and emotional support.

Thanks to the internet and various social media platforms, there is a vast amount of information to access. This can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on whether you are able to decipher the myths from the facts.
Living with Memory Loss can be a daunting journey for both the person living with Memory Loss and the care partner(s). The objective of this article is to debunk the myths associated with Memory Care, especially before any major life changes are decided. 
Myth #1: You or Your Loved One Will Lose Independence and Autonomy
Memory Care environments (homes) are designed to help those living with Memory Loss to be as independent as physically and mentally possible. The idea that these environments create a negative experience is antiquated and may stem from a time when there wasn’t much research or knowledge about the importance of Memory Care. 
Today, thanks to continuing education, people living with Memory Loss are cared for on an individual basis. This allows for personalized care so that the person may continue to experience life with dignity and receive assistance as needed. Team Members are specially trained to encourage self-care when possible. In most cases, those living with Memory Loss retain, and may regain, independence and confidence with the help of Memory Care facilities.
Myth #2: People Living in Memory Care Home Will Have No Interaction
As with lack of independence, years ago many nursing home environments saw those living with Memory Loss left alone in a room, ward, or a common area for hours upon end. Many people spent their time staring out a window or watching television shows. 
With modern Memory Care environments, there are daily and weekly activities scheduled to entertain those living with Memory Loss. These programs are designed to improve Memory Loss through physical fitness, socialization, arts & crafts, and therapy with music, art, and animals. Engagement and participation are the key focus goals of Memory Care environments.
Myth #3: All Memory Care Communities Are the Same
The truth is that not all Memory Care environments are the same. There are places that appear to offer programs designed for those living with Memory Loss. These environments may provide limited care and agendas that may or may not help to improve Memory Loss.
This is why it is important to investigate every Memory Care environment to ensure your loved one will receive the personal care they require. Having hands-on activities and programs that stimulate and encourage those living with Memory Loss can be the best support. 
Myth #4: Memory Care Costs a Lot of Money
A common myth pertaining to Memory Care is the extensive cost of the living arrangements. As with most assisted living communities, there is a fee for board, meals, specialized care, and other services. Each place has its own set costs and services.
In comparison, there is little difference in the cost for a professional living arrangement and the cost for care in-home. Whether there is a need to hire a care partner(s) or for a family member to leave a job to stay home, the costs can quickly add up. If the person living with Memory Loss requires physical assisted devices, these too can increase a care budget. 
Myth #5: You or Your Loved One’s Health Will Decline
Moving to a Memory Care environment (facility) is a good thing for those living with Memory Loss; it’s not a means to an end. In this type of atmosphere, the focus is on the physical, mental, and social well-being of the person. 
From healthy meals and snacks to 24-hour nursing care, a Memory Care home can help support and improve you or your loved one’s health. The custom programs are directed at slowing Memory Loss, improving your physical state, and retaining independence. 
Myth #6: You or Your Loved One Will Receive Better Care at Home
In-home Memory Care can be a well-received commitment. The health condition of a person living with Memory Loss extends into to their cognitive and physical health. All of the well-meaning attention, love, and support a loved one can give will eventually need to be replaced by around-the-clock care and medical attention.
Too many times, providing care to someone living with Memory Loss, as their needs progress, has a physical and emotional toll on the care partner and can be socially isolating to the person living with Memory Loss. By spending time focused on the person, their own health is at risk. Physical injuries, stress, and burnout can cause the care partner to also need medical attention. 
Myth #7: Memory Care Is Dull and Cold
The myth that Memory Care is associated with cold, dark, and dull atmospheres, again, may stem from the notion that those living with Memory Loss are best treated at nursing homes. This is not true. A Memory Care environment is physically designed with the person living with Memory Loss in mind.
Most communities are styled with comfortable home furnishings, adequate lighting options, colour-coordinated walls, and non-slip floors. Security, safety, social experiences, and mood-boosting amenities are all important in a Memory Care environment. 
Myth #8: Memory Care Sedates Residents
Before Memory Loss was medically accepted as a physical, mental, and emotional condition, those living with Memory Loss were sedated and placed in institutions. Thankfully, this is no longer the case. People living with Memory Loss now receive the treatment, and respect, they deserve, need, and desire. 
It should be noted that those living with Memory Loss may be prescribed medications by their doctor that may cause side effects of drowsiness.  These medications are monitored by licensed nurses with the support of their physician.  Memory Care environments work to find alternative solutions to medications, but if necessary, work to ensure the appropriate amount of medication is used to maintain quality of life.

34,Activities for People Living with Alzheimer’s and Dementia,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T06:41:38-05:00September 13th, 2022|Categories: Blog|"," For those living with Memory Loss either at home, in a long-term care home in Burlington, or at a Memory Care facility/environment, it is important to retain regular movement and stimulate the mind. Activities [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/activities-for-people-living-with-alzheimers-dementia/,"For those living with Memory Loss either at home, in a long-term care home in Burlington, or at a Memory Care facility/environment, it is important to retain regular movement and stimulate the mind. Activities such as puzzles, games, crafts, exercise, and gardening are just several of the daily tasks that should be encouraged.
As each day presents different scenarios, challenges, and new opportunities for the person living with Memory Loss, the activities need to be flexible. All programs and activities should focus on being failure-free and success-oriented. The chosen activity should be entertaining while stimulating. If the person living with Memory Loss becomes overly frustrated, consider moving on to a more success-oriented activity. Taking a break from the task at-hand can diffuse a negative situation and adjust the current mood.
Below we list some great activities for people living with Memory Loss.
Exercise and Physical Activity
Physical activity is important for the physical and mental well-being of everyone, especially for those living with dementia or receiving Alzheimer’s Memory Care. With any level of Memory Loss, there can be sleeplessness, restlessness, and signs of depression. Participating in regular exercise on a daily basis can improve sleep patterns and work as a mood booster. It can also increase blood flow to the brain.
Art & Creative Classes
Did you know that arts and crafts classes are used by Memory Care therapists to encourage sensory stimulation? Painting, colouring, knitting, and using craft materials offer an outlet for people living with Memory Loss to express their thoughts and feelings in tangible ways. These activities are useful in times where the vocabulary is limited or at a loss.
Simple One-Step Activities
Everyone loves a competitive game from time to time.  It is recommended when you participate in a game with a person living with Memory Loss that you focus on games that have only one or two steps. Cottage games like Cornhole, Frisbee Toss and Lawn Bowling to name a few that are simple adult games.  They are fun, interactive, social, provide light fitness and are easy to follow so that the person receiving Demetia Memory Care can always be included and follow along without frustration or embarrassment.
Herb Gardening
An herb garden can be started as a small hobby and grow as the person living with Memory Loss becomes enthralled with the daily care of the plants. This type of garden is perfect for those who may not be able to get outside easily to tend to an in-ground garden. Set up the herb plants on the kitchen windowsill or create a mini, indoor garden at a manageable level for the person.
Puzzles & Word Games
One of the best therapies for those living with Memory Loss is enjoying simple puzzles and word games. Using their brain power while having fun is a productive way to spend time. Most puzzles and word games can be easily manipulated to match the ability of the person living with Memory Loss.
Bake or Cook
The aroma of fresh baked goods and savoury dishes can bring back memories of times spent with loved ones in the kitchen. People living with Memory Loss rely on performing tasks that bring joy and allow for them to display their abilities. There may be some kitchen duties that require assistance or control by a support person for safety reasons, but by allowing the person with Memory Loss to do as much as they are comfortable with can encourage stimulation and enjoyment.
Clean Around the House
Having a sense of normalcy or purpose can help those living with Memory Loss and a regular routine can support their need for daily activities. Limit the activities to ones the person receiving Alzheimer’s Memory Care is physically and mentally able to perform. The goal is to create a task that gives a sense of purpose without causing frustration. Try endeavours such as sweeping, dusting, wiping tables and chairs, folding towels, and rearranging knickknacks. Break larger tasks into one-step-at-a-time tasks to help accomplish goals.
Play Music
Music is known to feed the soul! For some, slow expressive music stimulates powerful memories of childhood, family gatherings, and times with their sweetheart. Those living with Memory Loss that had an emotional or professional connection with music will find it therapeutic and stimulating. If the available music library is limited, the local community centre or public library may have a more vast selection to borrow from. Live music is another wonderful activity to partake in.
Watch Family Videos or Go Through Picture Albums
People living with Memory Loss may benefit by watching old family videos or looking through old picture albums.  Video’s and albums can assist with reminiscing or help people living with memory loss be reminded of the people in their lives from yesterday and today.  Families will often provide labeled pictures to assist the person living with memory loss refresh their memories of who they are and what role they play in their lives.
Reminisce About Their Life
Dementia Memory Care programs often encourage reminiscing about the past. For those living with Memory Loss, there may be parts of their life that bring great joy to speak of. Regardless if the stories are missing portions or end up being long tales, it is important to allow those living with Memory Loss to remember as much as they can of their past.
Animal Therapy
Animal therapy has been proven to help relieve stress, lower blood pressure, and boost one’s mood. For areas that do not have animal therapy services, a visit with a family member, friend, or neighbour’s well-behaved dog or cat can help. Visiting a local animal shelter or farm can also bring joy while diminishing any depressive thoughts.
Explore Nature
The great outdoors provides amazing physical, mental, and emotional health benefits. Stimulating activities can include, but are not limited to, walks or hikes, birdwatching, visiting a botanical garden, feeding the ducks at the park, or even sitting in a glorious flower garden. For those unable to venture outside, consider bringing nature inside with related books, videos, and freshly picked flowers.

35,Why It’s Important to Have a Safe Physical Environment for People Living with Memory Loss,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T06:39:15-05:00August 30th, 2022|Categories: Blog|", People living with Memory Loss can easily become confused or disoriented in the most familiar of surroundings which can put them at risk for physical harm. Providing a safe physical environment for people living [...],https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/safe-environment-people-living-with-dementia/,"People living with Memory Loss can easily become confused or disoriented in the most familiar of surroundings which can put them at risk for physical harm. Providing a safe physical environment for people living with Memory Loss is an important way to ensure their safety and encourage them to continue enjoying their daily activities. This is why specialized Memory Care environments, such as Memory & Company, are designed with the physical, emotional, and mental needs of their Members in mind. 
How Do Physical Surroundings Affect People with Memory Loss?
There have been numerous clinical studies highlighting the importance of a safe physical environment for people living with Memory Loss. As with other health conditions, dementia can affect each person differently and progresses in stages. 
The physical and social environments for people living with Memory Loss need to be structured to assist mobility issues, poor reaction time, and visual-perceptual difficulties. Cognitive difficulties can reduce a person’s judgement and make it harder to navigate their environment. 
Below are just a few safety features that Memory & Company offers to help people living with Memory Loss.
Security Features
As a person living with Memory Loss may not be able to recognize dangers within their surroundings, it is imperative that security features be put in place for their protection. Access to emergency exits, operational sprinkler systems, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and other alarms need to be properly managed and maintained. 
Secured Exits
Wandering is a huge concern for care partners and loved ones of those living with Memory Loss. At home, doors and windows should be kept locked at all times if wandering has become an issue. It is also suggested you use alerting technology that alarms or informs if a person has exited an area. Memory Care environments provide secured environments that limit the risk of elopement, and unsafe wandering by providing locking mechanisms that are only released with pass cards or door codes      
24/7 Supervision
When at home, it can be hard for care partners to provide 24/7 supervision for individuals living with Memory Loss. But having around-the-clock supervision can be essential as Memory Care needs progress, especially if wandering becomes an issue. In addition to providing security features and exit passes, a Memory Care environment requires 24/7 supervision by highly trained staff. 
Comfortable Designs
The design structure of the home or residence should enhance the daily activities of each person living with Memory Loss. Feelings of isolation and disorientation can be prevented or reduced with the proper settings. The design of a Memory Care environment actually presents unassuming pathways, safety features and colour schemes to reduce the risk of confusion and disorientation. 
Recreational Spaces for Members
To reduce the possibility of confusion in a Memory Care setting, creating centralized recreational spaces may help people living with Memory Loss get their bearings. The physical environment should be bright and roomy, circular in nature to avoid dead end hallways and should not contain dark shadows, which could trigger aggressive behaviour known as sundowning. 
Divided Space for Each Activity
The layout of a Memory Care environment should be properly divided up based on the room’s purpose (e.g., the kitchen, the dining room, and activity room). The pathway between the areas should be cleared of clutter and, if possible, provide a clear sightline between each room. By creating an accommodating space, the possibility of wandering and pacing is reduced. 
Dining Area with a Small Home-Like Space
Living in a Memory Care environment, the dining room area is set up like a personal home environment to encourage social engagement and eating. It is important for care partners and team members to be properly trained in the dietary requirements of those living with Memory Loss. 
Brighter Lighting Enhances Mood and Sleep Cycle
As many aggressive behaviours occur at sundown or after dark, having proper lighting is crucial to help those living with Memory Loss feel safe and comfortable. The indoor lighting helps maintain a sleep cycle and enhances the mood of a person. Bright lighting from natural sunlight and artificial light also helps to ensure the individual can clearly see their footing. 
Access to Outdoor Areas Lessens Agitation
Natural light can be enjoyed by spending time outside. Memory Care environments provide beautiful gardens for Members to sit, walk, and help nurture. It’s been shown that agitation and aggression can be reduced by spending time in the fresh air and by getting regular exercise. 
Team Members
The Team Members at Memory Care environments are an important part of ensuring the physical environment is designed especially for those living with Memory Loss. Each Team Member needs to be highly trained and knowledgeable in the conditions of dementia and understand the effects of Memory Loss. 
Medical Team Members for Specific Needs
In addition to having qualified Team Members caring and helping for the Members, a Memory Care environment requires a professional team of medical staff. To ensure their safety, health, and security, Members receive around-the-clock attention from licensed nurses and nursing assistants. They can also get access to a physician as needed and specialists can also be added to part of the physical makeup of the living environment. 
Medication Management by Team Members
These highly qualified specialists, physicians, and nursing teams work together to ensure the proper management of each Member’s medication. Oftentimes because Memory Loss can cause confusion and disorientation, medication can be mismanaged by the person living with memory loss. Those with Memory Loss are at a risk for serious health problems without timely administration of medication. 
Memory & Company’s Respite Hotel Service
At Memory & Company, people living with Memory Loss are provided personalized programs to enhance their lives while their care partner is fully supported by our Team Members. Our Respite Hotel services are available for short- and long-term accommodations complete with access to our Premium Day Programs.

Before you make a [...]",https://memoryandcompany.com/blog/in-home-dementia-care-vs-memory-care-environments/,"If your loved one has recently been diagnosed with a form of dementia, you may be exploring the options of either dementia care at home or a Memory Care environment. Before you make a decision, or have a discussion with your loved one, learn about the advantages and disadvantages of both options. This is an important decision for everyone involved and can have a major impact on the effects of the diagnosis itself. 
What Is In-Home Dementia Care?
Typically, in-home Memory Care is conducted by a family member or friend towards the beginning of the diagnosis. Care partners take turns supporting the individual with Memory Loss to ensure they receive the care they need from home. In most cases where a person living with Memory Loss is receiving care at home, it is often necessary to get help from trained professionals when the Memory Loss worsens.
As many people wish to remain in their own homes for as long as physically and mentally possible, in-home care is a good option for people living with Memory Loss. When professional care partners are hired, they can help with activities of daily living, also known as ADLs. The care partner can visit on a daily or weekly basis, while family members and friends could assist between visits. 
In-home care can include companionship, housekeeping duties, transportation for appointments, respite care for live-in family members, and assistance with meals, bathing, dressing, and other personal care. 
Pros of In-home Dementia Care
One of the main advantages of organizing in-home dementia care is the customized and personal services for the person living with Memory Loss. Other benefits include:

One-on-one attention
The opportunity to remain in familiar surroundings and in the comfort of home
Flexible costs based on hours of service needed
The choice of care partner
Scheduled hours beneficial to the patient
The opportunity to keep pets

Cons of In-home Dementia Care
There are a few disadvantages of in-home care, including: 

The high costs for around-the-clock care
Less opportunities to socialize with peers
Investment into house modifications may be required
The person living with Memory Loss is still responsible for regular home maintenance, supplies, and groceries
You may not be able to find someone compatible 
Cancelations of care support, or no shows for care is common
Inconsistent caregivers
Inability to handle anything that requires more than 1 person. 
Managing caregivers and being an employer can be overwhelming
No licensed nursing support 
There is a higher risk of theft or damage of personal belongings at home
Minimal care hours required for many home care agencies, beyond what may be needed

What Is Memory Care?
Memory Care is a specialized environment dedicated to the needs of people living with Memory loss. These environments offer thoughtful dementia friendly design, high staffing ratios, added safety and security, and specially trained staff that understand best approaches to care and programs. 
Successful memory care environments offer continuous programming and engagement, and ensure that the person is not isolated in their rooms throughout the day.  People living with memory loss are encouraged, supported and stimulated in life enriching programming.    
These environments can be found within an assisted living community or as a separate standalone memory care environment. 
Pros of a Memory Care Environment
Advantages of living within a Memory Care environment can parallel some of the in-home care benefits. Essentially, care providers can help the person living with Memory Loss to be more at ease with their surroundings. Some other benefits include: 

Full-time supervision
24/7 healthcare
Care providers highly trained in the study of dementia
Social interaction opportunities with peers
Regular social, physical, and mental therapy
Security with in-room call systems, motion sensors and alarmed doors
Easy-to-navigate hallways and rooms
Dementia friendly design
Easing the day-to-day responsibilities of the Substitute Decision Maker
Knowledgeable professionals that know how to manage the challenges of Memory Care
Home-like accommodations with features to avert disorientation
Open door policy for family members

Cons of a Memory Care Environment
Disadvantages of moving to a Memory Care environment can be compared to moving to a regular senior living environment.

High living costs for accommodation and specialized programs
The need to leave home and neighbourhood where many have spent most of their lives
Separation from family
Lack of privacy in a congregate setting
Learning to follow new living rules
Living with other people with dementia that may have varying needs
Not all environments offer one-stop all-needs-met solutions
Pets and smoking may not be allowed to live-in the Memory Care environment 

What Is the Best Choice for Your Loved One?
Specialized dementia care needs develop in various stages and come in many forms. Some people require little care while others may need around-the-clock care that cannot be met by family members or at-home care partners safely.
For people living with Memory Loss in the early stages, it may be beneficial to remain at home with the help of family, friends, and hired professionals. But as the condition progresses, it may be necessary to seek full-time care in a Memory Care environment for the benefit and safety of the person living with Memory Loss and the care partner. 
Memory & Company Respite Hotel Service
The Respite Hotel service at Memory & Company can help with stays as short as 3 nights, to long-term stays, as we are a licensed Retirement home.

Symptoms of dementia such as confusion, disorientation, and Memory Loss can turn a once-familiar home into a world of strange surroundings. 
From recognizing the different rooms to remembering how appliances work, dementia can create new struggles for those living with Memory Loss. The importance of introducing new gadgets can help enhance and even protect their lives.
Technology to Help People Living with Memory Loss
Technological innovations are designed to improve the everyday living activities of people living with Memory Loss. This can include mobility assistance, vision support, and tracking devices, as well as aids for social activities such as video calling and picture phones.
These technology gadgets provide people living with Memory Loss with a sense of independence while giving their care partners peace of mind. 
Below are some common technologies than can help people living with Memory Loss.
Voice-Activated Assistants
One of the newer gadgets to help with Memory Loss is a voice-activated assistant. Google Home or Amazon Echo (Alexa) can be strategically placed around the home to assist the person living with Memory Loss in any situation. From controlling thermostats and lights and reminding them of medication times, these voice-activated devices can enhance the lives of people living with Memory Loss.
Talking Photo Frames
Brain stimulation is important with Memory Loss therapy. A talking photo frame allows users to record specific dates, places, and names of the people in each picture. These albums can also be used to display various household items with a recording of what each one is and how it works. 
Motion Sensors
Memory & Company is the only Memory Care Home at this time that utilizes motion sensor technology throughout the building and individual rooms to alert our team of potential issues. These sensors can also be used by people living with Memory Loss to automatically turn on lights when a room is entered. This technology can also be used at home to monitor a loved one and be alerted of movement in any room needed.  
GPS Devices
The same technology we have in our smartphones for GPS tracking and location can be used to protect and keep those living with Memory Loss safe. These devices can be worn on clothing, in wallets, or even shoes to notify the care partner of any movement of the person living with Memory Loss. You can even set geo fencing technology to alert you if a person living with memory loss goes beyond a set area as stipulated by the concerned care partner.  This is great to maintain freedom for someone living with memory loss living in the community, such as going to their regular coffee shop or pharmacy without alerting, but if they go beyond a set perimeter the care partner is alerted and notified of their location.  
Clocks That Display the Time, Day, and Date
Another common issue for those living with Memory Loss is losing track of time, usually multiple times of the day. A clock that displays the day, the date, and the time can help ease the mind. These clocks can also be programmed to voice the information for those who have declining vision. 
Memory & Company’s Respite Hotel Service
As a safe and welcoming environment for those living with Memory Loss, Memory & Company’s Respite Hotel can be a solution for both short- and long-term stays. Our accommodations are designed specifically to enhance the lives of both the person living with Memory Loss and their care partner.  
Call us today to book a tour of our Respite Hotel and our Premium Day Program.

38,How Does Art Therapy Help with Memory Loss?,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T06:37:58-05:00July 12th, 2022|Categories: Blog|"," Despite all of the clinical studies and ongoing research in the field, there is still no cure for Memory Loss.

To help those living with Memory Loss, however, art therapy has become a proven rehabilitation technique that is performed in a safe and judgment-free space. The goal of art therapy is to improve the physical, mental, and emotional health of those living with Memory Loss. Communication, or the loss of it, is a major characteristic many people living with Memory Loss struggle with. Art is a perfect way to express what words cannot.
Art therapy is a specialized field focusing on stimulating expression through the medium of art. This can include, but is not limited to, drawing, sketching, painting, colouring, doodling, and sculpting. By initiating this type of self-expression, those living with Memory Loss are able to better manage stress and anxiety, explore emotions, and become more aware of their skills.
Benefits of Art Therapy for Dementia
With a properly organized art and Memory Care program, a person living with Memory Loss may attain a sense of purpose through expression with art. Art therapy for Memory Loss does not require great works of art or masterpieces. The goal is self-inspiration and self-motivation. Below are some of the major benefits of art therapy.
Increases Brain Stimulation
Those living with Memory Loss require constant stimulation to maintain a healthy mind and body. Art therapy can help a person living with Memory Loss recall memories, both short-term and long-term, as well as help them to increase focus and concentration on the task at hand.
Art therapy can also lower a person’s cortisol levels, which are responsible for controlling fear, mood, and motivation. When art techniques can capture the attention of a person living with Memory Loss, they can help them better process their emotions while improving their ability to communicate.
Improves Memory
Art entails various forms of expression through drawings, paintings, photographs, sculptures, literature, dance, and other creative outlets. With Memory Loss, art can become a form of communication and a way to sharpen memory recollection skills.
The act of drawing a picture allows the brain to form a picture and use fine motor skills to recreate that image on paper. Painting and sculpting have the same effect, and both can be used to help people living with memory loss express emotion.
Helps with Daily Functioning
Art therapy can play a role in the improvement of mobility issues. The brain’s parietal lobe region controls the fine motor skills. Through art, both the physical and cognitive functions are used to stimulate coordination through the use of fine and gross motor skills.
Engaging in even the smallest movements of the arms and hands through art can help those living with Memory Loss. In addition to stimulating the brain to focus on the art process, this form of therapy helps to reduce pain and discomfort.
Enhances Mood
As art therapy is an outlet for creative expression, it can help boost a person’s mood overall. Those living with Memory Loss may not be able to “voice” their inner thoughts or describe the times when they feel lonely or sad. Art can do this for them.
It is a well-known fact that when a person looks at a form of art, whether it’s a painting or sculpture, the brain releases dopamine. This is a hormone and neurotransmitter responsible for movement, motivation, and memory. Enhancing a person’s mood with art therapy can help improve their physical and cognitive abilities.
Art Therapy Provided at Memory & Company
The caring Team Members at Memory & Company understand how art therapy helps with Memory Loss. Working hands-on with our Members, we customize all activities, particularly art therapy, to support their cognitive health.
Memory & Company has partnered with the teams at Baycrest Health Sciences and the Art Galley of Ontario (AGO) to develop of an art therapy app for smartphones and tablets. This project provides users with virtual access to certain pieces of art to stimulate the brain and engage communication.
Baycrest Health Sciences is a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Toronto. Baycrest is an industry leader in the study of neuroscience and memory research for seniors.
Can Art Therapy Be Done at Home?
Art therapy is designed to be done under the supervision of a certified art therapist as each program is customized to the person living with Memory Loss. That being said, art therapy for Memory Loss can be enjoyed anytime, anywhere. For structured Day Programs, basic art therapy can be done in the comfort of the person’s home.
Depending on the capability and interest of the person living with Memory Loss, creative activities such as the use of colouring books, puzzles, and painting can be set up. Using photographs of past experiences, family, and friends to create a collage is another form of art therapy that can be successful. Any form of art therapy can help to stimulate the brain wave patterns, nervous system, and emotions.
Memory & Company’s Respite Hotel Services
At Memory & Company, our Respite Hotel services provide a safe and guilt-free stay for those living with Memory Loss. Stays include daily access to our Premium Day Program with cognitive and physical fitness activities, socialization, personalized programming, and therapies of pet, art, and music.
With short-term and long-term accommodations, the rooms are furnished private suites with a two-piece washroom, daily housekeeping and laundry services, and 24-hour nursing care. Medication management, bathing assistance, meals, and basic care packages are included.
We invite you to book a tour and have a discussion with our friendly Team Members to see how our Respite Hotel and Premium Day Program can help enhance your daily living, as well as your loved one living with Memory Loss.

It is a chance to experience social and learning programs while receiving appropriate care.
Care partners also benefit from specialized Memory Care programs by receiving educational support and respite time to recharge their own batteries.
In this article, we will look at the advantages of attending a specialized adult Memory Care program and how it differs from other day programs.
What Is a Specialized Adult Memory Care Program?
At a specialized Adult Memory Care Program, the focus is on helping those living with Memory Loss. The programs center around failure-free, success-oriented programs in a social setting.
As with other specialty programs, an Adult Memory Care Program offers a selection of activities, depending on the Memory Care environment. Services may include activities of daily living, social and recreation programs along with music and art therapy.
Studies have shown that being in a social environment while still receiving specialized care can help slow memory loss and improve sleep and mood.
How Is a Specialized Adult Memory Care based Day Program Different Than a Seniors or Healthcare Focused Day Centre?
With a growing ageing population worldwide, healthcare systems have begun to provide support through various organizations. Most cities have Specialized Adult Care Centres, Social Adult Care Centres, and Adult Healthcare Centres. While the shared goal is to offer support to adults in need, each Centre provides different services.
Charges
As expected, the charges for the various types of adult Day Programs are evaluated on the type of care provided along with the environment and services provided.
Specialized Adult Day Programs are roughly a fraction of the cost of obtaining personalized in-home care, with many added benefits including meals and knowledgable professionals. A full day’s rate can be less than hiring a professional care partner for four hours.
Attendees of the Day Program
Deciding which program is suitable for your loved one depends on the person who needs the services.
A Specialized Adult Day Program caters its services to those living with Memory Loss. Individuals may be living with a brain injury, Parkinson’s Disease, or a form of dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease. The layout of the environment as well as the activities and medical care provided are designed with Memory Loss in mind.
For programs provided at a Social Adult Care Centre, participants are immersed in a wide range of social activities. Designed for independent and assisted living members, these centres vary in offerings. Activities include field trips, music classes, Bingo games, and other entertainment programs.
In comparison, an Adult Healthcare Centre employs a team of medical staff to provide nursing care and related health therapies. Physical, speech, and occupational therapy are the cornerstones of these types of Adult Healthcare Centres. Often considered the middle support, these centres also offer a range of social activities for those requiring more hands-on daily living assistance.
What Are the Specialized Services Provided at Memory Care Programs?
For those living with Memory Loss, an Adult Day Program specializing in Memory Care offers a range of benefits designed to improve the quality of life of its Members and stimulate social interactions.
Cognitive Fitness
Memory Care focuses on programs to help slow Memory Loss. They offer a variety of programs and activities that focus on maintaining ones abilities, and challenge the brain in meaningful ways.
Physical Fitness
Physical fitness activities specializing in Memory Care can help to improve brain activity. In most Adult Day Programs specializing in Memory Care, certified Recreational Therapists design activities based on the individual member’s interests, abilities, and needs.
Socialization
Socialization and related activities have been critical in the mental and physical stimulation of those living with Memory Loss. An Adult Day Program specializing in Memory Care designs programs for group activities as well as one-on-one learning programs for those living with Memory Loss.
Personalized Programs
For an effective Adult Day Program specializing in Memory Care, activities and programs are customized based on the interests, abilities and needs of the individual living with Memory Loss.
Medication Management
Adult Day Programs are offered by a licensed centre who employees certified Registered Nurses and Registered Practical Nurses for the medical needs of the members.

An Adult Day Program specializing in Memory Care provides assisted social and medical support with a team of specialists. Personal Support Workers (PSW), Nurses, Social Service Workers, Recreations Therapists, and Kinesiologists that have the experience and training in working with people living with Memory Loss.
How Does a Specialized Memory Care Program Benefit Its Members and Caregivers?
A Specialized Memory Care Program, such as Memory & Company’s Premium Day Program, offers a social and physical outlet for those living with Memory Loss. With Memory Care-specific programs and activities, the goal is to slow down the progression of Memory Loss while enriching lives.
Care partners of those living with Memory Loss are also provided with support, education, and advocacy for the situations that can arise.

41,Signs That It’s Time for Memory Care,"Victor Kwong2024-01-10T06:26:08-05:00March 22nd, 2022|Categories: Blog|"," Having a loved one living with memory loss, such as with Alzheimer’s disease, is a reality for thousands of Canadian families.

If you are one of these families, recognizing the signs it is time for specialized memory care is crucial to provide the best overall care and support for everyone involved.
Memory care refers to the services provided for those living with memory loss. Specialized memory care environments are secure environments, staffed 24/7 by certified medical professionals with specialized training in caring for people living with memory loss. Your loved one will stay in a safe and judgment-free environment, complete with activities to help support their cognitive function and also provide a success-oriented and failure-free program.
Signs Your Loved One Needs Memory Care
Memory loss affects everyone differently depending on what area of the brain is affected. It isn’t a condition that provides a play-by-play outline, so understanding the signs that your loved one needs memory care can help you decide what to do before it becomes an unsafe situation.
Apparent Health Changes
One of the apparent signs your loved one may need care is seeing physical changes in their health and appearance. It is important to recognize these changes, as they may be the first signs that the person needs additional support and that it may no longer be safe for them to live independently.
Managing the Medications
Medication management is an executive function that involves organization, time management, and awareness of changes in health. Many people living with memory loss struggle to safely manage their medications on their own. This can lead to significant consequences if it’s not managed daily.
Memory care can take over some of the day-to-day responsibilities in this area, ensuring that prescribed and over-the-counter medications are given correctly and for the right reasons. They can also monitor the overall health and well-being of your loved one and make suggestions to adjust medications as their needs progress.
Weight Loss/Gain
Weight loss or gain is a major factor for many people living with memory loss. They may believe they have already eaten, or they may over-consume, believing they have not eaten, even though they just had a meal or snack. Your loved one may also no longer have the executive functioning to make healthy meal choices, such as eating only junk food.
Managing the day-to-day responsibilities of shopping and meal planning can often be a challenge. You may also find spoiled food in their kitchen or food prepared unsafely, which can lead to foodborne illnesses.
Lack of Self-Care
Another physical red flag that it may be time for memory care is your loved one’s appearance. Most people take pride in daily bathing, using hygiene products such as deodorant and soap, dressing up, and combing their hair. People living with memory loss often struggle to ensure all personal care steps are taken, often because it takes a series of steps to complete a single task. People with memory loss often require some cues or reminders to ensure all personal care steps are followed through on. Note that fear of water and apathy are also common with memory loss, which can make personal care more challenging.
Safety and Security
Since memory loss is progressive, the safety of your loved one should be top priority. Signs for concern include leaving stove burners on, having unexplainable cuts or bruises, or forgetting where they are in familiar places. Look out for disorientation regarding time and place, as this may increase their risk of wandering or getting lost. Lack of judgment, rationalization, and reasoning may also put your loved one at increased risk of unsafe situations.
Behavioural Changes
Depending on what part of the brain is affected, memory loss can sometimes cause behavioural changes and challenges. This may lead to inappropriate behaviour in social settings that may attract negative attention or put your loved one at increased risk in the community. Since rationalization and reasoning are often affected by memory loss, the person may need the support of a judgment-free and knowledgeable approach to decrease the risk of these behaviours, in a place with like-minded people.
Disorientation
Confusion and disorientation regarding time and place are extremely common for those living with memory loss. Ensuring a safe environment that supports people experiencing disorientation is very important.
Forgetfulness
We all tend to forget things from time to time, such as where we left our car keys or forgetting to pick up a particular item at the grocery store. These incidents are completely normal and are not a cause for concern. It is when you aren’t aware that you are forgetting that is cause for concern.
If your loved one constantly repeats questions, does not remember recent conversations, has disorientation in very familiar places, or is experiencing loss of executive functioning, it may be time for memory care.
Wandering Off
A huge safety risk for people living with memory loss is wandering. If your loved one is showing signs of wandering away from places, even familiar places, their safety is at risk.
Your loved may experience confusion and disorientation when going for a walk away from their home. Their judgment can be impaired and may result in walking into traffic, not following traffic safety rules, not wearing weather-appropriate clothing, or not knowing how to get back home even in the most familiar neighbourhoods.
Agitation and Aggression
Forgetfulness, confusion, and disorientation can cause those living with memory loss to become agitated or aggressive very quickly. In their mind, they may understand and know what they want to relay, but they cannot express themselves properly. This can cause anger and frustration.
Accusations of theft, manipulation, and verbal abuse are common among people living with memory loss. If your loved one is showing signs of aggression such as hitting, biting, or kicking, they may require specialized care, especially memory care.
Reduced Attention to Finances
Financial management is an executive function that most people living with memory loss struggle to manage. As the condition progresses, financial management can become a challenging task since the person can no longer grasp working with numbers and the multiple steps involved in managing day-to-day finances. Poor financial decisions are common, which can often result in missed bill payments, overpayment or repeated payments, excessive spending, risk-taking, or trusting people with their financial matters who do not have their best interests in mind.
Money matters are a hard subject to discuss, particularly with an elderly parent. If finances are not attended to, your loved one’s financial future may be in trouble.
A Decline in the Caregiver’s Health
Those who are fortunate to have a caregiver for their loved one, be it a family member or a hired personal worker, should take note of their physical and mental health.
Over time, depending on the rate of decline in the loved one’s health, the caregiver can suffer mental burnout, physical exhaustion, and lack of self-care. Without intention, this stress can be transferred to the patient. This can only mean one thing; it is time your loved one is placed into professional memory care.
Memory & Company’s Respite Hotel Service for Memory Care
Once you have decided when to send your loved one to memory care, put your trust into the loving hands of the team at Memory & Company, a designated safe haven for your loved one. Our compassionate team of nurses, personal/social care workers, gerontologists, and recreational therapists offers professional care and support.
Our goal is to provide the best service and treatment to those living with memory loss and their caregivers. Contact us today to discuss how we can help you along this journey.

As a caregiver, it can be a heavy burden to bear, especially if your loved one is in denial of their disease and unable to care for themselves like they used to.
Talking to someone living with memory loss about attending a memory care environment vs. an assisted living environment can be challenging. Quite often, they are reluctant to try new things. But there are a lot of benefits—not just for the person living with memory loss, but also for the caregiver.
How do you know which option is right for you and your loved one? It all depends on the quality and quantity of care the person living with memory loss needs, as well as the challenges that lie in the future.
What Is the Difference between Assisted Living and Memory Care?
While a memory care environment and an assisted living environment both share basic living services such as daily tasks, personal care, and lodging, there are specific differences.
For example, a memory care environment has a setting that is designed to give people a sense of calmness and security. It also provides programs to help with cognitive and physical development and improve sensory challenges that memory loss can cause.
An assisted living environment can also provide services for those dealing with the early stages of memory loss diseases; however, this type of care environment is designed to offer a limited form of assisted living in these cases and may not specialize in memory loss.
When researching assisted living and memory care in your local area, remember to focus on the provided care, staff qualifications, living arrangements, meal options, and the security.
We have compiled a list of the major differences between assisted living versus memory care below.

From long-term care to home care to a respite hotel, there are care options available for both the caregiver and person living with memory loss.
To help you choose the best option for your loved one, we will look at the differences between long-term care and home care, as well as determine when a respite hotel may be the better choice.
What Is A Long-Term Care Home?
A Long-term Care home (LTC) is oftentimes referred to as a nursing home. It is a residence for 24-hour personal and nursing care and is government regulated, funded and heavily subsidized. The government will pay for your personal and nursing care. Residents must pay for room and board.
Residents have to be assessed by the Home and Community Care Support Services through the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to determine eligibility. Most people that access LTC tend to require assistance with daily living such as bathing, dressing, and basic hygiene and can no longer live safely at home.
What Is Home Care?
Home care is a service provided in one’s private home. This allows a person to stay in their own dwelling and receive daily or weekly care from a professional support person. This can be offered publicly through Home and Community Care Support Services and hours and support are allocated based on determined need and is government funded.
Home care can also be accessed privately by reaching out to many different home care companies that will assist with all Activities of Daily living in ones own home. Individuals can book how often they require assistance from 24 hour live-in, to occasional visits.
What Is a Retirement Home?
Retirement Homes are privately owned and operated homes and offer varying services from independent living that is focused on social supports and meals, to assisted living with nursing and medical supports, to Memory Care environments with 24-hour nursing support and care for our most vulnerable.
Retirement Homes are regulated by the Retirement Home Regulatory Authority that enforces care and safety standards and support the rights of Residents. Stays are typically long-term and often used as an alternative to Long-Term Care. Payment is typically out-of-pocket and is not subsidized.
What Is a Respite Hotel?
A Respite Hotel is a new term that refers to short-term overnight respite to support caregivers getting a break from the day-today demands of caregiving for whatever reason. It also helps to support those requiring support and care that normally live in the community but need added support that home-care simply cannot support. Respite Hotels offer everything a retirement home has but allow for shorter stays with commitments only for the booked length of stay.
Most of the people using Memory & Company’s Respite Hotel are required to pay out-of-pocket for the service. That said, the cost out-of-pocket is often far less than hiring a home care professional and offers a more robust service with knowledgeable professionals. Memory & Company is a fraction of the cost of at-home care services and is HST exempt, tax deductible and covered by some insurance plans.
Main Differences between Long-Term Care, Home Care, Retirement Home and Respite Hotels
From medical assistance to social activities, it is important to understand the differences between long-term care, home care, retirement homes and a respite hotel, so that you can make the best decision for both you and your loved one based on your individual needs and budget.
Medical Needs
With LTC homes, the resident’s medical needs are met by an on-call physician, onsite nursing staff, and visiting specialists.
For home care medical services, nurses and specialists visit to attend to short- and long-term health conditions. In select regions, a physician can make a house call.
With Retirement Homes, each home has different offerings. It is important to understand the services available at each location to determine if the home meets the needs for today and for the future. Independent living offers only very light medical support, and care support is only available to those who pre-arrange this assistance when available at select times and additional fees. Often when Memory Care support is needed, residents are no longer eligible for certain retirement homes. Only select Retirement Homes offer Memory Care as it takes specialized staffing, higher staffing ratios and a supportive environment to help ensure the safety of those living with Memory Loss.
Memory & Company’s Respite Hotel offers a fully supported environment with 24-hour nursing, high staffing ratios and very knowledgeable staff that truly understand the needs of people living with memory loss. Our team is trained in best approaches to care, and ensuring our Members remain active and engaged throughout the day, rather than idle in their rooms.

Oftentimes caregivers become so preoccupied with caring for their loved one, that they neglect to care for themselves. This is how caregiver burnout happens.
Caregiver burnout is the state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion. Depending on the type of care provided, as a caregiver, you may experience this after several weeks or even years of caring for another person.
What Causes Caregiver Burnout?
Aside from the obvious physical work that can wreak havoc on your body, many caregivers can suffer from mental and emotional turmoil due to the demands of Caregiving. Here are some common causes of caregiver burnout.
Ignorance of Self
Caregivers often feel the need to put others first in order to provide the best possible care. While this is a wonderful quality to have, it can cause burnout quickly. This means that others’ needs often take precedence over your own needs. It’s hard to care for others if you aren’t caring for yourself too.
Unreasonable Expectations
As a caregiver, it’s understandable that you want to do everything in your power to help your loved one. But having unreasonable expectations or putting too much pressure on yourself can be a heavy burden to bear. In addition, your hard work and love for what you do may not be visibly acknowledged. This might cause you to feel unappreciated.
Not Asking for Help
Caregiver burnout can also occur if you attempt to take on the majority of the caregiving responsibilities on your own. In many situations, you may not have control over every aspect of care. You may need additional resources and/or more financial assistance to improve the quality and quantity of care. There’s no shame in asking for help.
Signs of Caregiver Burnout
The signs of caregiver burnout may not be noticeable at first. As a caregiver, you might feel like something is off, but just brush it off as stress and continue with your regular routine. Unfortunately, caregiver burnout is not something to ignore.
If you are a caregiver to a loved one living with memory loss, understanding the signs of caregiver burnout can help you take better care of your loved one and of yourself.
Fatigue, Irritability, Hopelessness
Constantly looking after another person can be tiring. If you are also dealing with caring for someone with declining physical or mental health, such as memory loss, this can cause a sense of hopelessness for both parties.
Sleep Problems
Even with a routine and schedule, a live-in caregiver may not have proper sleep patterns. Depending on the care provided, you might notice that you are physically sleeping less than four hours at a time. You might also worry about the days ahead or the health of your loved one, which can cause sleep problems.
Getting Sick Frequently
A mild cold is expected from time-to-time. When these circumstances happen more frequently, it may be a sign of caregiver burnout. The physical and mental stress of caring for another person can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to viruses.
Social Isolation
Isolation from family, friends, and social groups occurs gradually. You might start off by making excuses for not attending social functions or gatherings. If you feel underappreciated for your work, you might notice that you begin to shy away from interactive activities with others. As more “walls” are built up, caregiver burnout becomes more evident.
Feeling Like Caregiving Is Controlling Your Life
You may suspect you are experiencing burnout if the endless work hours seem to increase. A full-time caregiver may be spending 16 to 24 hours a day being responsible for someone else. Between the chores and personal hygiene tasks, there are days a caregiver rarely has time to relax. If you feel like caregiving is taking over your life, you may have caregiver burnout.
How to Prevent Caregiver Burnout
Whether you choose to become a caregiver as a profession or you suddenly find yourself assigned as the provider for a loved one, caregiver burnout is inevitable. Here are a few caregiver burnout prevention techniques you can try to ease the strain.
Learn Acceptance
It can be hard to accept the fact that your loved one is declining and you can’t do anything to prevent it, especially if your loved one has memory loss. But as a caregiver, you need to learn to accept the situation and focus on the areas where you can make a difference. It is up to the caregiver to accept the situation and plan accordingly. Do not blame your loved one or the world.
Separate Personal Life from Caregiving Life
It’s important to separate your personal life from your work as a caregiver. It’s not easy—especially for a live-in caregiver—but it can be done. Ease your mind, body, and soul with things that bring you joy. From family time, to hobbies, invest in your own time to prevent burnout.
Ask For Help
As mentioned, there is no shame in asking for help. There are likely people around you that would love to help in some way if they knew it was needed. Plus, there are often many community resources available to ease the burden of caregiving. From short-term nursing care in emergencies to respite options, there are also private programs and organizations to help ease the burden of caregiving.

Did you know that approximately 35% of working Canadians 🇨🇦 are balancing unpaid caregiving responsibilities at the same time?
